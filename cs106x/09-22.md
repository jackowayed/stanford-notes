# Syntactic Differences Between C++ and Java

    #include <iostream>
    #include "genlib.h"

    int main(){
      count << "Hello, world!" << endl;
      return 0;
    }

endl flushes as well as adding a \n

You don't get automatic initialization. In Java if you say `int foo;` or `boolean foo;` or `Object foo;`, it's set to 0 or false or null. In C++, you have to iterate through and initialize or it'll be some random value.
