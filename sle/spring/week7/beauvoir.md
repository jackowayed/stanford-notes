# Beauvoir

One is not born, but becomes, woman.

Original title of *The Second Sex*: *The Other*

Many saw it as hating men.

Between 1st and 2nd wave feminism.

Published 1949--only 5 years after women got the vote in France, 11 years after women were given "legal competence". Before 1938 in France, woman couldn't get bank account or passport without husband's permission. 

But husband was still able to forbid wife from employment, choose her career. Husband owned all family property, including stuff from before the marriage. Father was only legal guardian of children. Those didn't change until 1965.

Beauvoir passed special French test 2 years after women became allowed to take it. Didn't go to Ecole Normale, which is how basically everyone passes.

Married Sartre except without the marriage.

## Basics of Existentialism

### Existence precedes essence.

Aristotle thinks the reverse. Essence of letter opener is the need for thing that opens letters. Aristotle would think that came before the actual letter opener. Think of something we want, then make it.

Sartre says we think of human beings the same way. There's a function for human beings that existed before we did, and the God/whoever made us to fill that function.

Existentialism says that should be reversed.

First, we exist. Our job is to determine our essence.

### In-itself (en-soi) vs For-itself (pour-soi)

We're jealous that things in the world don't have to think about how they're doing, what they should be doing, etc. No consciousness. That's the in-itself.

For-itself is consciousness. Consciousness has no content. Like a window. Conscious *of* something. Even when thinking about thinking (like Descartes' cogito), that's just reflection consciousness on itself. Making consciousness a thing and being conscious of that thing.

There's nostalgic energy of for-itself to be in-itself. Longing to have a fixed essence.

Anguish--experience of not having an essence and wanting one.

Freedom is central. Freedom to create our own essence.

"Condemned to be free"

#### Bad faith

way to pretend we have essence, let others give us an essence. Mix of unconscious & conscious efforts.

Resting from choosing who to be.

Not really bad at times. Is kinda bad if we get stuck in it.

### Facticity

Part of the world that doesn't have to do with our freedom.

### The Other

Consciousness tends to treat other people as objects--just fixed in-itself. And people sort of like that because they sort of long to just have in-itself.

Shame. Feeling what it's like to be seen as an object by others. "Shame is by nature recognition. I recognized that I am as the Other sees me"

## Second Sex

Both men and women are responsible for women's oppression. Also comes from problems that are basic to human subjectivity.

The social role of men coincides with the transcendence of facticity. For women, they're an object either way because of the cultural situation.

Choosing objecthood: women are the Other

Affirming subjecthood: women embrace objecthood.
