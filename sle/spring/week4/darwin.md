# Darwin

First goal: show that species had not been separately created.

Second: Natural Selection

"Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection"

Made Galapagos observations when only 26.

## Evolution

= "descent with modification"

Only used the word "evolved" once in Origin of Species

At the time, prevailing view was that species were designed by God, have existed since then and have not changed (though some go extinct)

No essences--fundamental characteristic of life is variation.

Mockingbirds.

Notes: "this undermines creation", later added a "would"

Galapagos observations that stuck out to him:
* basic similarity of organisms in Galapagos & South America
* Parallel features in different species
* Morphological variation

## Natural Selection

Natural selection was *main but not exclusive* means of modification.
