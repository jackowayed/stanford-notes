## Bio

Brilliant in school. Became professor at 24. Letter of rec "This man can do anything"

## Eternal Recurrence of the Same

Nietzsche thought this was his greatest idea.

Thought experiment--imagine your own life will come back to you. Gets you to assess the value of your life to your own standards. Your reaction to the idea that your life would come back to you is telling.

Test for whether your life is good. Posits joyful affirmation of your life as good.

### Why does he think this test is important?

Speaks to your identity as a person

Do you really like yourself?

Do you affirm the life you actually have lived?

### Features of this test

Doesn't give the way to evaluate life. Wants to activate the standards you have. Gets at your actual standards instead of what you feel you should believe by disorienting you.

Very same life in every detail: Prevents our thinking away the practical importance of the past. Has to include "at least I'll never have to go through that again" moments, which people tend to exclude.

Repeats over and over. Looking for very strong attitude of affirmation--no variety for all eternity, so affirmation means a lot.

Transforming Christian idea of redemption and breaking apart.

When something bad has happened to you, something that redeems that is good.

But Christian idea is that you need compensation in the form of a different good life.

Nietzsche thinks we actually need to make the regrettable part of our life better. Do something about the life you have to make it so that you want your life again.

Ex. Jimmy Carter had great ex-Presidency thanks to the need for redemption caused by the crushing defeat in '80.

## Geneology

Investigation that doesn't assume that conventional values are the most valuable things. The values need a critique.

### 1st Essay: Criticism of Good/Evil

Concepts of good and evil come from slave revolt motivated by revenge.

Rejects the idea that good = altruistic, unegoistic, etc.

Good started as noble, of the higher classes, etc.

Evidence: Words that started meaning noble ie. high-class came to mean noble ie. good.

possible: Christian values are strategy for getting revenge against the happy.

Pattern of values is self-defeating. Eg. can take revenge, but can't take pleasure in it

### 2nd Essay

Guilt is a moralized form of self-hatred and ascetic self-pain

Ressentiment

How did the slave revolt spread?

Guilt is not just internalized punishment

Related to debt.

### 3rd Essay

Idea that guilt's not a problem, it's good.

Suffering is universal, needs an explanation and meaning. If you can convince yourself that you're guilty, suffering is a punishment, then it means something.

In every case, the real worry about traditional morality is the way it turns people against themselves.
