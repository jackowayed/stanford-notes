# On Liberty

Ideology = cognitive map. Hence, they're new. Modern thinking--times are changing. So we're always going into new ground, meaning we need maps. Not true until fairly recently.


## Liberalism

first ideology, possibly the last one to survive too

Tries to answer:
* What is human nature?
* What is the nature of the social order? How do we balance our desires & community.
* What's the source of value? What's good/bad? What's worth doing?

Smith's model of market were extended to a giant "market" where exchange of ideas looks like exchange of commodities.

No guarantees in Liberalism (like with a God), so always doubt. Liberals general believe things are getting better, but never know if it'll last.

## John Stuart Mill

James Mill born poor.

But got lucky, like most who significantly improved their lot in life them. A local land owner (John Stuart) saw that he was smart, sent him to study theology. James probably didn't believe in God, but he was cool with it anyway.

Couldn't get a job as a pastor, so became freelance writer.

Spent a lot of time educating his son, John Stuart Mill.

John Stuart was very well-versed in classics, with the intention of making him a great thinker.

Much more interested in reducing pain than in pleasure.

At 20, Mill had epiphany. "Suppose all the objects in your life are realized. ... Would this be a great joy and happiness to you?" Realized his answer was no, partially thanks to his father pushing him.

After dealing with this, stays a liberal, but a qualified liberal. Eg. He believes in the market, but he's prepared to see it qualified because it has a kind of cruelty.

Committed to democracy, but at one point thinks voting should be weighed according to education.

## On Liberty

Want lots of exchange of ideas for intellectual progress, just as Smith said we want lots of trade for economic progress.

Freedom to express our ideas even though many will be very wrong and all will be a little wrong gives society the possibility of approaching more satisfying versions of truth.

Problem with giving people what they want is that it might not actually be valuable. Like his crisis at 20.

Is liberalism enough?
