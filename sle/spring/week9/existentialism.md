# Sartre and the Limits of Freedom: Locked Up

It's hard to have a shared experience even when we're objectively sharing an experience. When we see something as us & others doing something, that's a serial relation.

## Contexts for the play

### Sartre's life

Wrote in 1959. His last original last play.

People have called it *No Exit* on steroids. More people, longer, etc.

He reread *No Exit* much while writing.

He wants it to be like No Exit in some ways and very unlike in others.

Torture seems set out to be worse than other things. Worse than killing. Why is it so bad?

Sartre has been getting closer to communism in this time.

But he criticized their policies often, esp. Stalin's camps.

Since he wasn't in the party, communists hated him for these criticism. But he said USSR wasn't too bad, so normal people hated him too.

So he got really isolated. Also became workaholic. Took drugs so he could stay up and write fast

Sartre is having trouble because he wants to say Nazi torture is bad, but existentialism makes it hard to say that.

Concurrently is writing theoretical work trying to mesh existentialism with historical materialism.

Wrote about family. What is the family and how does it shape freedom?

### Sartre on Theatre

Sartre thinks that the most important part of theatre is decision-making.

Bourgeois theatre tries to get people to connect with the characters.

### Sartre's Marxism

practico-inert. Similar to alienated labor. Comes out of our labor. When we labor, we make stuff, and that stuff takes on a life of its own. Our labor has taken the form of an object, and now it often is an obstacle.

Sartre sees practico-inert as broader.

Father's company was main example of practico-inert in *Locked Up*. He build the company himself, but now he's basically just a cog in it.

Seriality. Series is form of social relation where we can't experience ourselves as a collectivity, but as isolated.

Sartre's great example: Waiting in line for a bus. Everyone is waiting for the same thing, wouldn't be a community if it weren't for that thing.

Some chance of others becoming obstacles to us (eg. maybe there won't be enough seats). Leads to people thinking of themselves as not part of the group. Everyone else is an obstacle to our goal.

Sartre thinks seriality is how we experience almost every form of group interaction. Part of the problem is inventing scarcity.

### Algierian War & Torture

France tortured Algierians for info about rebels.

## Play itself

France thinks torture makes us an other, but so does waiting for a bus. Is torture that bad compared to things we do in a war?

We don't seem to need existentialism for this play. Says torture/war/Nazis are bad. Fits pretty well into bourgeois theatre, getting us to places Sartre wouldn't like.

Franz tortured to maintain his power. Knew they would be tortured, so he figured he should do it, assume full responsibility, etc.

His choice to become torture was based on something historical--tortured because he didn't have power.

Sartre is much more interested in the torturer than tortured. Being tortured isn't that bad; allows people to be heroic and show great resistance despite the limitations of the physical world.

Whats really bad is being a torturer. Franz has become an other to himself.

Seems like a way to assume human power, assuming our freedom (at the expense of others). But really turns us into an object. Turns our own human being against us.

Condemnation of a certain will to power. Has a history. Depends irrevocably on our other which turns out to be ourselves.
