# Dual Revolution

Emergence of towns was big. Even in 18th century, ~90% lived their whole lives in the rural place where they were born.

Human body becomes an object.

Countryside becomes place for vacations, picnics.

Have people paint a picture of your property so you can doubly-possess it.

2 Revolutions:
* social & economic (Industrial)
* political (French)

## Industrial Revolution

Largely British.

Was about harnassing energy for production of goods other than food. Become consumption goods.

Starts in Florence 15th century. Woven materials.

Emergence of new class. People who's income are made from production of consumer goods. Not land owners; own the factories ("means of production").

## Glorious Revolution of 1688

Often presented as Catholic-Protestant conflict.

James II was a Catholic, childless king. People weren't concerned 'til he had a kid because before then they figured they'd get a Protestant king soon. Overthrew him after he had his kid.

End of autocracy. No more divine right of kings.

William, his replacement, had to take an oath in front of parliament that he would uphold he bill of rights. (Rights of parliament)

Bill of rights established liberalism. No taxation or raising army without parliament's consent.

---

France became "revolutionary cockpit of the world". French Revolution became emblem other revolutionaries looked to.

## Commune of 1870

Paris was ruled for weeks by men & women in a communist way.

Eventually defeated, thousands slaughtered.

## Consequences

Emergence of free market.

Proletariate takes the place of that state.

Rise of self-consciousness of working class.

Bismark's Germany: first welfare state.

Dominant ideology: progress. Not something people thought about 'til 18th century.

Progress became a given, but recently has been called into question due to environment, inequality, etc.
