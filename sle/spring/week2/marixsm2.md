# Marxism

Proletariat = property-less

History = class struggles

Thought capitalism was a great development. It unleashed incredible energies.

Thought imperialism was good. Progressive. Spreading capitalism.

"The number of jobs created by IT is far below the value" (Me: Seen from the other side, the amount of value each IT worker creates is way more than workers in other industries. Super-efficient.)

## Refutations in Manifesto

### Abolition of Private property will lead to idleness & lead to collapse of means of production

Private property doesn't apply to the masses. The workers don't have private property as it is, but they're not idle.

### Communism is a Denial of Individuality

To free society, you must do away with property, which is used to enslave others.

### Communism destroys the family

They said capitalism weakens the family.

### Communism is against nationality

Said that it was about all workers uniting.

### Communism is Against Religion, Philosophy, etc.

Human beings make history. In Marxist thought, no room for possibility that an external factor (like God) can step in and make history. But there can still be a god.
