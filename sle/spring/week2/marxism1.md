# Marxism

"It is from the midst of this putrid sewer that the greatest river of human industry springs up and carries fertility to the whole world. ... Humanity achieves for itself both perfection and brutalization."

### Why was Marx so well-placed to analyze 18th-century Europe?

He was a marginal man. Born in the Rhineland. Born a Jew.

## Hegel

Thesis = an object. Thesis creates its antithesis (complement). Can only see red because of the presence of all the other colors.

Synthesis is the consequence of the tension between the thesis and the antithesis. Ability to see is the synthesis of the thesis red and the antithesis not-red.

Historical change. History is the history of change from earlier ideas to later ideas.

Germany passed law forbidding peasants from gathering leaves and twigs from forests because lords own that forest. Established private property. Marx wrote his first important editorial criticizing this.

Marx and Engels reject utopian socialism.

React to the failure of the Revolution of 1848. Marx hoped that working class would rise up. Reevaluates the necessity of revolution. Sees democracy as a weapon; working class should struggle for democratic rights.

Marx thought socialism would come from industrialism, but social revolutions ended up starting in nonindustrial areas.
