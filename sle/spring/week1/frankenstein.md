# Frankenstein

Mary Wollestonecraft Godwin--daughter of 2 radicals

Godwin brought Mary to read at her mother's grave.

Distance between readers & characters-> Theme: Who can speak, who can't, whose silent, whose story is hidden

## Men of Discovery

Similarities between Walton & Victor:
* Ambition
* Science
* Penetrating nature (sexual language)

## Battle of Belief

## Gender

Women generally passive. (eg. Elizabeth gift to Victor, Victor's father and mother)

Elizabeth similar situation to Victor's mother.

Victor obsessed with beauty. Love beautiful people, hates ugly creatures.

## Victor ~= Mom

Takes ~9 mo. to make creature, then post-partum depression.

But Victor gets skinny instead of fat as he nears completion.

Nap after birthing--dream of Elizabeth turning into mother's corpse.

## Vol 2: On Ice

Vol. 2 basically starts on ice again. Everything is a mess.

Romantic sublime = being next to massive forces of nature--feel small, but connected to the infinite.

---

Society often represented as the monster. Society excludes, judges on appearance, etc.

Safie again is a strange prize.

---

Creature feels disconnected from Great Chain of Being.

## Vol. 3: Unions

(Remember that Shelley's parents hated marriage)

## Female Monster

Victor imagines her having agency, even though he didn't imagine the first having agency or the women in his life having agency.

Afraid she may want human men.

## Big Deaths

"Big death" on the bed on the wedding night when it's supposed to be the "little death"

Almost cuckolding.

---

Creature and Victor get more alike as the story continues.

At the end, Victor's death consummates creatures crimes. Victor = creature's bride.

Recapitulating the fall.
