# Romantic Poetry

Romanticism: began in German. 

We're still sort of living in a post-Romantic era.

wildness, irregularity

Ideal--overthrow established authority of church, the academies, etc.

Can mean:

* return to Middle Ages
* Love of exotic
* revolt from reason
* exaggeration of individualism
* rejection of conventions
* return to nature
* glorification of force

"deforming and ultimately self-destructing power of egocentricity" (Cory Booker) becomes a positive value

ego expresses itself via imagination

Made strong claims about what you need to do to be artist:
* Be ruthlessly honest about yourself and inspect your inmost motives
* Accept that your inner life and the outer world are profoundly at odds.

Inner life becomes an explicit topic of literary exploration-reaction against empiricism & materialism of scientific revolution.

## Wordsworth

started super radical, got very conservative as he got popular

Was mocked for selling out, but he became Poet-Laureate of England

Was most productive when he moved near Coleridge and was still young and radical.

Really explored and exposed the parts of himself that most try to hide.

"Guilty Boy Poems": Nutting, boat-stealing scene from The Prelude, Intimations Ode

Thinks women are more spiritual, less aggressive, live on a higher plane.

Guilty boy is guilty because his soul meshes badly with the demands of the social world.

## Keats

Agreed with Wordsworth that self-alienation was the big problem, but didn't like Wordsworth's solution.

### Negative Capability

when man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, and doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason
