# Montaigne

Jeremy!

## Biography

Born 1533 to newly noblized family. Newly converted Catholics.

Father fought in wars in Italy, took ideas from Italian Renaissance. Story that he spoke nothing but Latin to Montaigne 'til he was 6 so he'd learn Latin before French.

Montaigne studied law. Tax court. This was one of the first times when posts of nobility were sold (instead of just inherited).

Married by early 30's. 6 children, only 1 of which survived infancy.

Sometime after 1570, father died, he retired to a life of scholarship.

## European account of new world

Read the histories, but didn't necessarily trust them. Trusted accounts from commoners more than from scholars.

Recent discoveries had questioned how much they knew about the world (no real reason to believe there weren't even more continents)

Montaigne saw new world as a place to project and reflect critically on European culture/values.

In France, most are Calvanists, erupts into serious of Civil Wars.

Big massacre of protestants--15k killed--largest # of civilian deaths from 1 event 'til WWII

How can we decide what we know for certain?

## Skepticism

Academic-you can't know anything for certain

Pyrrhonian-you can't eve know that much (we know too little to judge whether certain knowledge is possible)

Ataraxia--spiritual state of rest.

Skeptics had tools to either demolish beliefs or support the pro and con simultaneously.

---

Montaigne wrote an essay that was supposed to be defending some Sebond argument. Said basically that even though it has problems, any other argument can be thwarted in the same way his is. Turns into an essay saying we can't know anything. Apology for Raymond Sebond.

## Apology

Trying to say that we can't know anything, so we should submit to God.

His advice on Catholic vs. Protestant is to go with the law of the land--no one knows anyway. Hope that God is telling the right thing to do.

---

(Not sure this is Apology or just in general)

Says there's no way to be certain that our reason and intuitions are correct. So we shouldn't even mess with things like 2+2=4 and speed of light = 3e8 since there's no way to know.

Also says we should keep our hands off of religious truths (eg. bread & wine turn into body and blood of Christ).

## Essays

He wrote lots of essays with extremely varied length and topic. Topics included friendship, thumbs.

He had several versions of many essays. Published them, then would add more over time. Basically never removed or edited what was already there, just inserted more.

His essays investigate his own process in reasoning, what he's doing when he reasons, how that changes over time.

Says that he'll write about anything, doesn't really care, because he just cares about his judgment, not what he's writing about.

## Cannibalism

Shows that we can't use Aristotle/Plato in this case.

Says we can't use the accounts of people who have been to America because they're not simply recounting what they see, also giving a worldview.

Finally, simple man who went there and came back, gives Montaigne privileged info.

His account makes them sound a lot like inhabitants of the Garden of Eden. Except for the whole cannibal thing. Montaigne uses this as the symbol of cultural difference.

Montaigne says it's not any more barbarous than what Europeans are doing.

Some conclusions. Shows his penchant for proving A && !A
* Says they are barbarians where "barbarian" == customs different from ours
* Savage where savage == natural, vs European artificiality
* Barbarians becuase of their cannibalism
* Not savage because they are more virtuous (valiant) than Europe
* Not barbarians because their art is as sophisticated as ours

Possible theses:
* Cannibalism is comprehensible. Some contradiction
* The savages of New World are more virtuous than Europeans. But how do we judge such virtue? Those virtues are European. If we have same virtues, why do we seem so different?
* Barbarity is difference between us and them--relative. But they do seem better than us
* **Barbarity is the disparity between theoretically espoused virtues and lived practice. Europeans are savages, as we live differently than we claim we should.** No contradiction. But it would have nothing to do with the inhabitants of the New World. But that should convince us that this is the thesis, because he likes talking about random shit to end up just making a point about himself.
