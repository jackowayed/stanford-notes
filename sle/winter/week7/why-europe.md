# Why Europe?

## 5 Transforming forces c. 1500

* printing press and coming of the book (printing press, but also paper instead of parchment)
* Consolidtion of European state system--more centralized
* Demographic transformation--after the Black Death, population starts to recover, doubles very fast, leading to lots of change in society
* Religious revolution--things get so bad that they must figure out how to get religion out of politics and religious tolerance.
* Opening of the Atlantic world--focus shifts from Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Capitalism. Elevation of standards of living. New balance of world power--Europe extends religious wordwide and exports its culture, values, prejudices, tech, etc.

## In 1490, its weaknesses were very apparent

Population small

Not that advantageous:
* Ice made things shut down in winter in the north
* East very vulnerable to attack
* Had less access to Asian than a couple centuries before
* Ottoman Empire was spreading to Eastern Europe, cut off main route to Asia.

Ottoman Empire was kicking ass and China was the most the most sophisticated society in the world.

China:
* Printing 400 years before Europe
* Great armies
* Sophisticated bureauocracy
* Etc

China also had shown their ability to expand overseas. Had massive ships (5x longer than Portuguese ships) that voyaged to Arabia and East Africa.

In 1433, Zheng He stopped voyages. In 1436, banned making the ships and traveling abroad. Not sure why.

Paul Kennedy: Emporer had too many people, too much territory, too much power over it. Had no rivals to push him. So he had no incentive to promote change. Whereas Europe was super-fragmented, so all 500-1000 states were competing.

And colonization guaranteed that it would be a lasting expansion. Instead of being transitively there to trade or live as guests, typical European pattern was to take over and live there.

## Canaries, Mediars, Aesors

The stepping-stone to America was the Canary Islands, Mediras, and Aesors (sp?), where the stopped on the way back due to the currents making it hard to go north up the W African coast (so they swang out west). Spain and Portugal fought over them repeatedly because:

They were stepping stones to Africa and around Africa to Asia (can't settle in Africa because of disease)

For sugar planations, which are lucrative and were taken by the Ottomans.

Made the islands "Neo-Europe". Brought European culture, plants & animals, church, etc.

This provided a model that they used in New World.
