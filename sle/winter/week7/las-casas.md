# Las Casas

* Benefited from Indian slave labor
* Characterized as anti-Colonial, pro-Indian autonomy

Released all his Indian slaves and created a utopia with priests, farmers from Spain, free Indians.

He gave accounts portraying Spanish terrible treatment of Indians (burning alive, etc) to give a picture of the Indians that disputed the accounts of Vespucci, whose works had become standard.

Vespucci said Indians were naked and unashamed. Attractive and lecivious.

Story he told: Women had poisonous animals bite partners' penises to make them swell up and eventually explode.

Vespucci said Indians didn't have set meal times, would urinate in the middle of conversations, cannibalized.

In contrast to Vespucci's attempt to make Indians sound exotic, Las Casas tried to make them seem very normal--had government, reason, etc.

But he also used emotion, trying to shock people into trying to demanding change.

Black Legend: set of stories about Spanish misdeeds.

Some thought about the New World as a lost Eden--Eden they hadn't known about.

## Sepulvida

Good demonstration of how Aristotle was used in Europe.

Argued that war against the Indians was just becuase it put them in the natural state of being subservient to more-sophisticated people.

Said that people have the duty to make that justice, even by force

## Las Casas's response

They're not as barbaric as we think, and it's not right to use force to do stuff.

Not innovative. Agrees with Spanish Law, which says that Indians are people, can't be enslaved or deprived of stuff.

What was new:

### Problem of authorities

"Goodbye, Aristotle" Some claim that this is stepping out of traditional framework to put experience > authorities.

Does Las Casas challenge the authority of the canon, or just interpret it correctly? He cites the authorities as if he's just interpreting it. But are his interpretations defying them?

### Problem of eyewitness

"I am the oldest of those who went over to the Indies. In the many years I've been there, I have not read others' histories, which could be lies. Instead, I have experienced. Only I have been an eye witness for so long. Only I can be trusted."

Sepulvida and others had only heard about things from the histories.

At the time, it was hard to rely an argument on eye witness. Had problem of authorization--why should he be taken seriously? Especially in the face of other eye witness reports that flew in the face of it. Why should any single voice be taken as authoritative.

To be convincing eye witness, have to become a convincing "I-witness". The eye had no authority until the reliability of the person was established. Descartes establishd this.

### Problem of universalism

Pioneer defender of universal human rights.

One of the first to break from Aristotilean hierarchy--the idea that difference necessitates hierarchy.

"The nature of men is the same"

"have by natural laws the same rights" "all human beings are in their essential nature identical"

This thinking is freighted with difficulties both in the modern world and for Las Casas

Some problems:

#### Emphasizes likeness

So how does he deal with the major differences that do exist? Says they were both part of the same history, but the Indians were less far along in the cultural evolution. Europeans' ancestors were very similar.

This decontextualizes them, presenting them as pre-Europeans, which suggests they should be easily assimilated.

Does say that men have a duty to listen to those who can lead them to virtue (and Christianity). They have a right to defend themselves against invasion, even by more civilized people. But in time, Indians might start following Europeans and adopt European systems. -> gentler, more subtle (more insidious?) form of colonialism.


## Conclusion

Toteroff (sp?):

Las Casas loved the Indians, but didn't understand them in their particularity. Through his assertion that all men are alike, he took possession of them for Europeans.

Cabeza de Vaca loved the Indians and understood them.

Because Las Casas believed in the superiority of European culture, his egalitarianism lead him to assimilationism.

Sepulvida and Las Casas both lead to justification for colonization of America, just in different forms (war and enslavement vs. peace).
