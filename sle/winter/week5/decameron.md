# Decameron

100 novellas, plus stories within stories, introductory stories, conclusion stories, etc.

Many are more racy.

## Biography

Is he medieval or renaissance? Or modern?

Boccaccio was first to call Dante's comedy divine. Decameron = human comedy

Dante did vernacular poetry, Boccaccio did vernacular prose.

Dante had a type of matrix--1st Canto of each was similar, 2nd of each was similar, etc.

Boccaccio took that farther, made it so you could read in any order.

Boccaccio not interested in your salvation, but in the experience fo pleasure you have in life now

(Dante's work goes sinners->paradise, Boccaccio starts with sinner that everyone thought was good, ends with a very saintly woman, but does it playfully)

Restoring social bonds that were shattered by the plague.

Unparalleled narrative realism.

Varies social levels from lowest to highest.

He calls Decameron "the most humble"

1313-1378. Plague in 1348

Born out of wedlock in Naples

50-75% of people died in Florence (where he was).

Bases Decameron on that:
* 7 women
* 3 men
* meet in church, abandon church
* run from the city to escape the plague. Tell the stories
* Go to Fiesole

## Plague changed social strctures

Attitudes toward women changed. Women were in the streets begging for help when they got abandoned.

Neighbor = contagion, death

Christian church lost spiritual authority. Promised cures that it couldn't deliver. People felt abandoned by God.

---

dedicated to Prince Galeotto--"was the book and he who read it" in Dante when Francesco and whoever adulterized inspired by the story of Lancelot. "warning label"

specifically for women--lots of things they couldn't do due to society, so he was giving them pleasure.

Story tellers also become king or queen as they tell story--rotating monarchy

Dio Neo does last story each day. Unpredictable. = no one was ready for the chaos of the plague.

---

story telling is art of speaking well. 

---

Language is an extention of generocity. One thing you can give to neighbor lasting after they die.

18 stories interested in silence.

Mute Eventually gets trapped in his own story (of being a deaf mute)

## Tancredi

Complex nature of desire--we may not even know our own desires

Desire servers as form of camouflage--present but not seen.

King should be in public space, enters her bedchamber (private). Present but hidden.

Bedchamber = female body.

Tancredi desires incest?

Rigid king working via coercion: vs rotating monarchy

## Garden motif

Dante started in dark wood.

Boccaccio interested in sunny garden. Domestication of nature -> pleasure

Garden is nature under governance of art

Lifeless garden.

Decameron looks at reordering society by way of the aesthetic
