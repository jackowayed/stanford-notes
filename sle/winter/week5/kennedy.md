# Citizen Armies

David Kennedy

Strutre of the Army shapes the decision making about how we use it.

"How can it be that the Army is at war, and the country is not?"

Our army has some of the attributes of a mercenary force. (He's **not** disrespecting soldiers)

Our force: all volunteer, relatively small, relatively inexpensive

What is the impact of those characteristics on political accountability, social equity, social comety(sp?)?

## Mercenary-ness

Army paid $620M in signing bonuses to convince people to enlist in '08. Up 25% from the year before.

~75k aliens serve in the army. In '02 Bush fast-tracked citizenship for these people.

Part of why women weren't thought ready for full citizenship in the past was that they weren't thought ready for full military service.

Citizen army historical benefits:
* Strengthening civic engagement
* Defining citizenship
* Encouraging political accountability for use of military force

WWII: >12% of the population was serving in the military, vast majority drafted. Military budget 40% of GDP

Today: <.5% of the population. Military budget is only 5% of GDP.

US accounts for ~50% of military spending worldwide.

US military is exceptionally lean and lethal. Far more destructive than any rival force, and far smaller than any time since WWII.

So the most powerful military ever can go into battle without most of the country really noticing, everyone going is volunteer, etc.

This makes "military adventurism" very easy, which is something our founders feared greatly, which is why they prefered militias over standing armies.

## How did we get here?

Nixon was looking for ways to quell anti-war sentiment. Thought getting rid of draft might help. In '73 selective service stopped drafting, military shrank.

Abrams tried to configure the force in a way that would prevent a repeat of the Vietnam War. Result: Total Force Doctrine--redefined the reserve from strategic to operational.

ie. instead of holding the reserve back until a decisive moment in the battle when we needed it, deploy it from the outset. Can't deploy the active forces in a significant way without also deploying the reserves.

Mobilizing reserves means you'll necessary disrupt civilians, which should raise threshold for deploying the military.

Part of why Vietnam festered so long is that they didn't deploy the reserves--so it was just young, unencumbered draftees (not 30-year-old fathers) going to war.

Congress tried to do the same thing with the War Powers Act (which may be unconstitutional).

Congress has only declared war 5 times--1812, Mexican-American, Spanish-American, WWI, WWII

But we've deployed significant amounts of troops 234 times.

Weinberger Doctrine (aka Powell Doctrine): 6 principles to honor when deciding to use military force:
* Don't commit forces to combat unless it's necessary to the interests of US & Allies
* Only wholeheartedly w/ clear intention of winning
* Only with clearly definied objectives
* Relationship betwen objects and the force should be constantly readjusted
* not without reasonable assurance of support of public opinion and Congress
* only as last resort

Colin Powell added:
* Force should have overwhelming strength
* Need exit strategy

Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA): 10x improvement in accuracy of weapons is equal to a 1000x improvement in explosive power.

In Gulf War, "smart" weapons were only ~8% of our force. In the Iraq War, ~90%

In WWII, killing 1 target took ~600 bombs dropped by ~100 airplanes.

On 1st night of Afghanistan war, it took a few hundred airplanes to destroy what, by WWII standards, would have taken 17k airplanes.

These developments have been great, but also facilitated the undermining of the Total Force doctrine. These strategic weapons have allowed us to shrink our army so much that only the willing/desperate go to war, and even calling up the reserves doesn't make a big enough impact.

In '07, ethnic/racial minorities were ~42% of the military. (Way overrepresented)

In the 18-24 age range, 72% have done some higher education. Of military of that age, only 2%

Of the 307 general officers, they had 180 kids in the military. "Family business"

Of the 535 members of the Congress, they have 10 kids in service.

Letters to him about his editorial attacked the rich, the securely employed, the well-educated, and universities, especially places like Stanford that don't let ROTC on campus.

His summary on ROTC: Keeping them away means we have minimal impact on the leaders of the military, which is a very important organization in society with a lot of impact on the world.

Questions:

## Military Contractors

Had about as many contractors in Iraq as soldiers at height of the war. ~30k licensed to use force

Having people who are licensed to use military force but not subject to normal chain command is asking for trouble.

## Why can't Congress use power of the purse to curtail use of the military?

Very hard to be seen as obstructing the military after the troops have been deployed. "Support our troops" == "support my war"

## Question about military spending norms (ie not during WWII)

During Cold War we spent ~10% of GDP on military

(Doesn't really seem like a problem to me to go from 10% to 5%, and 5% is still a lot, especially since our economy has grown so much)

## ?

Called the president being able to deploy without much risk of repurcussions of a moral hazard.

## Final Story

Went to the White House in '06, talked to Bush about history and how historians would write about him and such.

Bush pointed out that he personally communicated with the family of every fallen soldier.

Said "If I'd had to go into Iraq with a draft army, I'd be at peace by now." (Because he'd have to be. People wouldn't stand for this long of a draft war)
