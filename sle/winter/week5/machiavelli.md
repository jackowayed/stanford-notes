# Machiavelli

Negative view of Machiavelli has existed since it was published

*The Prince* is not about morals--just says what works and what doesn't

Wrote *Prince* and *Discourses* concurrently

In Discourses, said that republic is the only good govt.

But also wrote handbook for princes.

Diff between Ciceronian republicanism and Machiavelian:

Militia is test of civic virtue

Civic virtue decays very easily. The freedom allows them to do their own thing, stop living up to their duties, may even give selves over to one-man ruler so they don't have to pariticpate as much.

Machiavelli's brand of republicanism makes his 2 writings compatible. Not a hypocrite/opportunist. He's saying that when a republic has failed, princely power must be accepted as the way to revival

## Morality in politics

One must sometimes be cruel to be kind. Sometimes in politics you need to do "bad" things to seek power.

Personal morality and political morality (virtue) are different.

Cicero claimed that acting morally is always the right path.

Machiavelli thought Christianity and politics shouldn't mix. Won't condone the violence necessary for prince to keep power. And it undermines republics--republics work better when everyone seeks for self interest. Christianity doesn't respect republic enough, saps people's political virtue.

"The republic is out of season. We need to conform to the circumstances"
