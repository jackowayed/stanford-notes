# Inferno

Primary concern is to probe, understand, represent nature of motion.

## Canto 1

Very confusing

Narrator is stuck without Vergil's help.

Dante was clinically depressed shortly before writing *Inferno*. Had been exiled from Florence. Doubted the political system.

This poem is Dante's therapy. Self-mobilization.

Usually leader is a saint an an angel, here it's a poet and a pagan.

"In the middle of our life's way"--in medias res.

This poem happened to be the middle of Dante's life (35 years old), but really this just means a turning point where you must change path.

The way to the top of the mountain is down into the earth--must "undergo a conversion"

Spiralling motion--mix of linear and circular.

## Crisis

## Choice of Vergil

Dante sees in Vergil the "dynamic imperative". In Aeneid, Aeneas had to keep going until he got to Rome, even with many good stopping points.

Dante learns from Vergil what it's like to write dynamic, epic poem.

## Motion

Aeneid is earth-bound, while Divine Comedy is heaven-bound. Aeneid is rectalinear motion, Inferno has rectalinear + circular.

## Rhyme Scheme

33 Cantos in each of the 3 poems. 3 = trinity = important

Rhyme scheme is terzarhima (sp?)

Verses are in sets of 3 (tercets). ABA BCB CDC DED

Each rhyme appears 3 times.

## Sin

Soul has 2 main faculties: Will + Intellect.

Desire is part of will.

Other than limbo, the burden falls entirely on the damned's free will. Sins fall on the will.

The damned are where they want to be. Their desire and will got them there.

Rather than a place of torture, Dante's hell is a place where the nature of each sin is revealed by its punishment.

In Dante's hell, no sinners are repentant.

Infernal motion does not lead anywhere. It's useless, endlessly repetitive. Hell's occupants are stuck, just as Satan is stuck at the bottom.

Have to climb onto the body of Satan--middle of hell--to start climbing.

When they start climbing, everything has been turned upside down. Were descending clockwise, start ascending counter-clockwise.

In purgatory, they have to do things just as bad, but it's liberating motion. They're purging their sins.

## Love = Motion

The love that moves the sun & stars turns the pilgrim like a wheel.

The sinners in hell love as much as the non-sinners, their love is just misdirected.
