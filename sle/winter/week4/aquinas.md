# Aquinas

No major work.

Aquinas has build "cathedral of the mind". As incredible, thorough, systematic, etc. as a cathedral.

---

pinnacle of systematic thought (integration of what + why)

re-centering of senses and natural world (seeds of system's unraveling?)

born c 1225, son of Count Landulf of Aquino, Italy (rich)

groomed to be Benedictine abbot (powerful)

late teens, joins Dominican order (mendicant)

"The one sure thing we can know about Jesus is that we should in poverty"

studied theology in Paris & Cologne

1256 began teaching in Paris.

Summa Contra Gentiles--apologetics (defense) for missionaries to Jews & Muslims. summary: If you think Aristotle is right, you should be Christian

Summa Theologiae (primer on Christianity)

1273 "All that I have written seems like straw to me". Some kind of epiphany.

1274 (3 mo later) dies. contraversial when he died.

eventually canonized.

## Rise of Scholasticism

Fall of Rome & spread of Islam

rise of universities

apologetics

need for rational systematizing. need for method

scholasticism = rational justification & systematic presentation

form: meant to mimic what would happen in university

## Summa's proofs of God

Aquinas was trying to prove that reason could have something to say, but wasn't really directly arguing that God exists.

contra Anselm

agrees God is essentially His Being

but not self-evident that he is so

Anselm starts from thought, Aquinas starts from sensible world.

5 ways:
* basis of motion
* causality
* contigency
* perfection
* behavior

Had to examine language--what can philosophy say?

univocal: "Nicole is a teacher" "Greg is a teacher"

equivocal: "Baseball players use bats" "Bats flew out of the cave"

analogical: "I love my wife" "I love playing basketball" "I love peanut butter sandwiches" "I love teaching"

can speak analogically of God

until now, theology relied on Plato

discovery of Aristotle helped solve some problems that came from relying only on Plato

We know things through natural reason & phil, and we need that as well as sacred doctrine to believe that god exists.
