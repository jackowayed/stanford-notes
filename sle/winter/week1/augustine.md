# Augustine

Lee Yearley

"What is this thing man that you honor so?" or something like that

## Who is he?

Sarte: 1st existentialist

Others: Founder of orthodox Roman Catholicism.

Protestants: First Protestant

"Perennial philosopher"

---

self is a continuing puzzle to itself, only in search for God does self appear

Clearly a *crafted* portrain of a life.

Confession: Accuse yourself + praise how God acts in people's lives.

Argues against "If I know the good, I'll do it"

## Pear Incident

Echoes Garden of Eden.

Shows human beings can act for no reason.

This capacity "puts a wildcard in the deck" when it comes to describing human behavior.

## Pelagianism

### How free are we?

If god is omni*, how free can humans be? Musn't he control all of the world?

Freedom = freedom to adopt values

### What role does freedom play in this messed up world?

Either God can't or won't abolish evil. If he can't, he's not omnipotent. If he can, he's not all-good.

Human freedom may contain the answer to this dilemma.

Augustine: humans aren't free at all. Because of what moves them from the inside, society, God.

Again, he cares about values--whether people can will themselves to be attracted to good.

## Donotism

How good do they have to be?

To be a member of the Christian community means to be different.

Augustine: no. Nobody is good.

## Manichianism

Are there 2 independent principles? (1 for good, 1 for evil)

Augustine: "I didn't <do that bad thing>. Something inside me did."

## Neo-Platonism

## Classical "Good Sense"

Stanford

Lived a well-lived life.

Only satisfying thing is to reach beyond reasons he should have been happy (good job, life, kid, etc)
