# The Early Church: Augustine to Boethius

## Augustine's Life

Harmonized theology & classical philosophy

Born 354 CE in Hippo (rural area).

World was Mediated by petrons--liasons between people of his area and the Roman Empire.

His father scrimped so that he could give Augustine the education of a rhetoritician--this would allow him to move up in the Roman bureauocracy. (Like pre-{med,law} now).

Instead, he became Christian, priest, Bishop.

Lived through the decline of the Empire. Wrote *City of God* after barbarians sacked Rome in 410 and people blamed Christians for weakening the empire.

He died while barbarians sieged Hippo.

Augustine's father wants him to be a rhetoritician and wants him to develop into a man--masculinity, sexuality, etc.

His mom didn't like that he was sexually developing because she saw it as temtpation to sin.

---

Manichean--creator God is evil because he created world with evil.

## Dualism: great chain of being, varying perfection

Man's imperfect mind can understand perfect eternal truth (like 3+7=10). Illumination with God allows us to see these permanent truths.
