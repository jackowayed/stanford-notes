# Talmud

Judaism is continuation of the Torah + comes from radically changing texts after the 70 CE destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.

## Oral Torah

Interpretations the Rabbis give of the Torah. They claim that what they say is what God told Moses on Sinai when he gave them the written Torah.

Talmud = Mishna + Gemara

### Mishna

200 CE

Gives various laws like family law, religious law, business law, etc.

Just debates, no conclusions.

Seems to contradict the Torah at times.

## Gemara

600 CE

Commentary on the Mishna.

Among other things, argues that when the Mishna seems to contradict the Torah, it doesn't.
