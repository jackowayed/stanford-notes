Where sugar was grown, enslaved people died. Torrid climate. No offseason. Brutal physical labor. Processing was bad too. On average people only survived 7 years in a sugar plantation.

Native Americans made bad slaves. Little agricultural experience. Had people similar to them living very near. Died more easily.

Total for slave trade, ~12.5M were taken from Africa, ~10M made it to the Americas. Most didn't go to North America.

Iberia slave traded with Congo for 140 years before taking any to Americas. Congo had converted to Christ.
