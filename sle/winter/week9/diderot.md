# Diderot

Enlightenment brought the general thinking public up to the new ways of thinking.

Voltaire got very rich from the sale of his books. Rare.

## Encyclopedia

Diderot and someone else did first encyclopedia. Primarily was about science, especially how technology worked with very precise illustrations. Also tended to show setting in which the manufacturing takes place.

Encyclopedia was censored and outlawed after 7 volumes.

Was subversive with cross-references. Eg. eucharist had a cross-ref to cannibalism

Requires active engagement

A set cost 2 years' wages of a skilled laborer, 6 months of Diderot's wages

## Oral Dissemination of Ideas

### Coffee House

Coffee was new. New form of sociability formed around coffee.

Was expensive. People had to be reasonably rich.

Men.

Was a political space. Talked about ideas, petitioned, hung up broadsides with their ideas.

### Salon

Has women.

Women lead the discussion. Requires one to be polite.

Mixing of social elite and intellectuals.

Mixing of nobles and newer wealth.

In a private space.

Free to be an oppositional space because it's private, unlike things like a court.

## Diderot

Active member of coffee house, writes it into *Rameau's Nephew*.

Was briefly a friend of Rousseau. Rousseau liked his work.

Didn't publish Rameau's Nephew in his life.

## Fighting within Enlightenment

### Natural law

Of Locke, etc

Men even in the state of nature know right vs wrong. Inherent.

Society is for security and because they sympathize with fellow man.

Diderot added that man has aesthetic sense. Beauty disposes people to do good.

## Rameau's Nephew

Dialog between rational and 

Human beings are good. Art helps people be good. Evokes feelings that are the same as what you feel when actually doing good. Which makes you want to actually do good.

### Need to visualize the scene very precisely

In a garden across from the Louvre. More like White Plaza--busy, not very ordered, beehive of ideas & activity.

This allows him to set themes using the scene. It's at the crossroads of the materialists and the thinkers. He's a thinker looking at the pleasure-seekers.

Also shows that it's a commentary on the current time.
