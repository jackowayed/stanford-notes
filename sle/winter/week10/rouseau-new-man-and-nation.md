# Rousseau's New Man and Nation

Social Contract--republican

Emile--education

## Confessions

Tons of ego.

Hated Paris because:
* Placed demands on him which clashed with demands he made on himself. City demanded that he act in a manner fully alien from himself.
* Too much courtesy. Hurt and repelled him. Saw through it. Friendliness that knew no personal friendship. Everyone is wearing a mask.
* Everyone was dominated by society. People know only how to live based on the opinion of others. Value their lives based on others' opinions.

Feelings very important. Rousseau makes self-examination not just the starting point for the search for truth, but the whole thing.

## Emile

Emile just like the Discourse looks for the genesis of evil.

"Everything is good when it springs from the hands of our creator. Everything is degenerated when shaped by the hands of man"

Wants Emile to be super-moral.

Freedom: only desire things you have the power to get.

Wants Emile to equate self interest with common good--republican.

Shelter him from society and corrupt public opinion.

Follow the child, take the lead from him. Don't counter the child's impulses; naturally good. Curriculum shouldn't be based on some external idea.

Let childhood ripen, allow them to unfold.

Timing is key--can't force kinds of learning before they're ready. Hence the books in Emile roughly map to life stages. Age-graded education was a new concept.

Rousseau thinks puberty is critical. Tutor has to handle it right.

Tutor is manipulating and forseeing the next lesson and preventing wrong behavior instead of relying on Emile to be good.

Only describing the education of boys. He thinks there are sharp differences in social roles.
