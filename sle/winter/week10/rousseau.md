# Rousseau

Jeremy!

Showed movies depicting bad human nature. Gets at Marxian idea that our nature is changeable has grown worse. This partially come from Rousseau.

First Discourse: Has the Restoration of the Arts and Sciences had a purifying effect upon morals? Rousseau: No. (Contrary to public opinion). Won the prize, became a sensation.

Second: What is the source of inequality among men, and is it authorized by natural law? (He did /s/source/origin/, which shows that there was a time when there wasn't inequality but somewhere in history it began, rather than a present source.) Rousseau: It's a long story ... and no.

## Preface

Trying to criticize other natural law theorists. Says their way of understanding the state of nature is to think about humans now, strip away the things they don't like about society, and dump men out in nature.

## State of Nature

Instinct for preservation

Premoral instinct for compassion

Capacity for self-improvement--distinguishing feature.

## Transition into Civil Society

Youth of the World (p. 110-115). First gathering together, first relations, sedentariness. Decides this probably happened due to scarcity--need more planning to generate enough resources. "Some fatal accident"--wasn't necessary. Probably the happiest time. This leads us to start comparing ourselves to each other. Partially because we've sufficiently evolved/degraded to be able to have strong passions.

Nascent Society (p. 116-120) Because of agriculture and metallurgy. Aren't necessarily evil, but leads to division of labor, which leads to people working for one another.

Civil Society (p. 120-135) Now. False social contract. Rich convinced the poor that it's better for everyone to work together, but really society just helps perpetuate inequality.

? Violent Revolution (p. 135) Only one will decides everything (monarch), and then a violent revolution overthrows society and restarts the cycle.

## Moral inequality not authorized by natural law

p. 117 (p. 137)

Inequality is only ok if it lines up with natural inequality (of ability, etc).

## Humans in the Second Discourse

Start with:
* 2 instincts: self preservation & compassion
* 1 capacity: self-improvement

End with:
* pride, passions, reason, reflection, (im)morality)
* institutions that preserve & replicate moral inequalities

### These changes are irreversible

Rousseau: p. 153-4 (8-page note I) We have to stay with society and keep respecting the laws. They'll keep making us worse, but it's all we've got.

Critiques reason.

Then why did he write Emile? What's the point of educating someone for a world like this?
