# A Look at Renaissance Painting

Looking at Mona Lisa.

4 ways to look at it:
* Really look (an hour?). Fovial vision is only 2 degrees wide, so have to move that across whole painting.
* ?
* Genre. Allegory? Portrait? Can be several
* Social context

## Really Look

Ideally ~an hour.

### Pose

Mimic it yourself to get an idea of what it's really like.

She's very twisted. Her chair is facing parallel to the canvas, so she has turned to face us.

### Gaze

Where she's looking.

### Setting

Balcony. You can tell that she's above the ground based on how you can see the outside. Also can faintly see railing. 

Landscape is wild. People usually didn't have houses near it.

### Scale

She's huge. It's because she's a lot closer than the background, but makes her more monumental.

### Rhymes

"Visual rhymes". Things comparable in shape. Acts like poetic rhyme--emphasis.

Curvin of her scarf, the road, and the river all similar.

Scarf also is spiralling--movement, and like how she's kinda spiralled around.

Why does she have the spiralled scarf? Go to the constructedness, not to possible reality ("that's how it was"). Leonard was big into motion, including movement of water. Looks like some of his drawings if moving water--connect her to natural forces.

---

Florentine painters were interested in organizing picture plane.

Lisa is vaguely a triangle in the plane. If 3-D, pyramid.

Leonardo was fascinated by our vision and such. Binocular vision may be why we see a bit too much nose.

Interested in relief--making the flat painting 3-D.

### Also

balance, rhythm, proportion

## Genre

Portrait--pretty new. But Leonardo kept it--odd for the time.

Could also be portrait of friend/mistress of one of his patrons, but still odd that he kept it.

Very different from more traditional potrtrait painted by Rafael responding to Mona Lisa.
