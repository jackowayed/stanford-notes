# Protestant Reformation

Reformation tore Europe apart religiously, socially, politically.

Massive religious violence/warfare in the century after. 100k killed from one war.

Not inevitable, nor was the Church so bad that it needed this level of reformation.

Clergy filled many of the bureaucratic roles of government.

Church was biggest landowner, so they were landlords

Secular lords. Pope, many bishops were heads of secular states.

Many bishops held benefaces (basically, getting taxex from a certain region) lived far away from those places (different countries).

## Catholic penetential cycle

* Born stained with original sin
* Baptize--if they look like they might die, baptize them ASAP--to confer grace, wiping away (at least temporarily) the stain of original sin.
* Begin to sin again, due to flawed human nature
* Confess to priest, get absolution (for penance)
* Repeat
* Die

Problem: Can die (almost certainly will, since you sin again very soon) when not in a state of grace, so can't go straight to Heaven. Fix: you go to purgatory, work off those sins for thousands of year, go to heaven.

### Luther's problems

* Dependent on human action. He says people can never earn salvation (because sins are so grave that human actions can't balance it out).
* If you realize the above, it's impossible to ever feel forgiven and grace-ful.

## Luther

God freely forgives us, and we're forgiven forever.

Believer covered in "cloak of alien righteousness"--wrapped up in Christ's righteousness. Can stop living as a sinner.

### How did Luther get there?

Father was a miner, did pretty well, sent Martin Luther to university.

At university, Luther finds himself in a terrible thunderstorm, prays to God saying that he'll become a monk if he survives, so he does.

He gets doctorate in religion.

Indulgences! Idea is that the money is charity as pennance for sin, just like how you might have to take a pilgrimage to Rome as pennance. But since it so directly is an exchange of money for salvation, it highlights the issues Luther already identified.

Luther sees self as a reformer. Just wants to fix the issues.
