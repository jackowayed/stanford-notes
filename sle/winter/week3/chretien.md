# Chr√©tien de Troyes

## Background

People perceived history differently--saw many more texts as history, like Song of Roland, stories of King Arthur, etc.

Today, history = account of events, usually including causes. Back then it often bordered on literature.

Unifying characteristic of stories is that they were in the vernacular.

Until 11th century, Latin was only written lang, literature was clerics' realm.

Rise of chivalric class, feudalism, etc. formed *illiterate*--literature for those that were illiterate in Latin but very learned in French.

## Reading of the Romances

### Treatment of Erotic/Courtly Love

In Erec & Enide, shows that erotic love and being a knight can coeexist.

Troubador poem, he fails to sustain adulterous relationship.

## Erec & Enide

Erec must think of not only him & Enide, but also others and his duty as knight. Ethic of action. Social reciprocity.

Enide must not be silent, but be a catalyst.

## Knight of Cart

Does Lancelot's love for Guinevere noble-ize him or immasculate him.

Hestitates before going in the cart--knows it's shameful.

Very single-minded--either fainting or going full-out.

To prove that they're playing the roles right, they must be perfect queen & knight.

"perfect adulterous love"

Never really resolved how Lancelot is both perfect knight and perfect lover.

Chretien didn't finish it, may be because he couldn't find a perfect ending.
