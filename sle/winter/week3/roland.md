# Song of Roland

Very popular, many versions.

Became part of core of French identity. Read in schools.

Audience would already know the plot.

Existed at least a century before the Oxford manuscript.

## Plot

Charlamagne conquered all of Spain but Saragosa.

Muslim king Marsille promises conversion, tribute, etc. for peace.

Roland nominates Ganelon to go to Saragosa. Ganelon hates Roland.

Ganelon nominates Roland for rear guard, has Muslims ambush rear guard.

Works, rear guard all dies.

Roland refuses to blow the horn, asking Charlamagne to come back and and rescue them even though Oliver insists.

Eventually, Roland does, but too late.

Charlamagne kills Muslim emir.

Ganelon is tried at end. Has he betrayed Roland? Charlamagne?

Ganelon's kinsmen stand with him.

There's a judicial duel to decide, anti-Ganelon wins, Ganelon and his kinsmen are executed.

## History

Based on Charlamagne's rear guard's ambush by Basque Christians.

Charlamagne was widely regarded as saint even before canonization. 

Sainted partially because he converted the Saxons.

He never lead a crusade, but in the 12th century people thought he did.

Vassals of your vassal are your vassals.

Can take fiefs away from vassals if they're not loyal.

But treason to the king might be loyalty to family, group, etc.

Nothing to enforce loyalty but coercision and moral pressure.

These bonds got more clearly contractual in 12th century thanks to lawyers.

People at top of feudalism (king, etc) started enforcing that they were the most important, must sacrifice everything, betray other loyalties, etc. for them.

---

A king tried to divide the aristocracy so that he could get more power. Didn't work.

The epic says that Ganelon is wrong to assert that he can carry out a feud with Roland, placing his honor above loyalty to Charlamagne. Validated when God intervenes in duel deciding this.

Many in the 12th century would have thought this wrong.

It's not evident what treason is. Debates are inconclusive in many other texts. Emphasizes the lack of clarity in what loyalty means.

Can one renounce their loyalty and then do things against the king?

Can one questionably kill a traitor?

If lord breaks a pact, is vassal still loyal?

Song of Roland is mostly one-sided. Only complicated debate is whether Roland should blow his horn.

Moral: Loyalty to Charlamagne trumps every other loyalty.

## Why?

The fact that Charlamagne is crusading doesn't seem to be the reason that he is owed complete loyalty--never makes that argument.

Crusade ideology does make it more of a binary--with us or against us--which is projected onto the complex issues of loyalty, simplifying it. Since the Muslims were definitely wrong, Ganelon was too.

The 2 duels--Charlamagne vs. the emir and the one at the end--where God helps

(Christian rewards less materialistic than Muslim)

Loyalty to king is similar to loyalty to god.

Defeat of the rear guard became a victory--Muslims were defeated, created martyrs, etc.
