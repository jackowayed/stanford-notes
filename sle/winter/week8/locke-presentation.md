# Locke: Second Treatise of Government

## State of Nature

Starts by talking about nature. Men are born in a "state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature" and "state of equality" where no man has power over another.

"being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions"

Do have a right to punish those that violate the state of nature for "reparation and restraint"--to have the wrong made up to you and to discourage them from doing it again.

Violating the laws of nature "declares war on all mankind"

Everyone has the power to determine if someone has wronged and to punish them.

Everyone is in this state unless they consent to leave it.

## State of War

If you violate someone's rights, you take away their freedom in some way, and freedom underlies the rest of your rights, so that puts you in a state of war with them. This makes it lawful to kill a thief. Once they start violating natural law, you have no reason to believe they won't fully do so.

State of nature != state of war. State of nature is when everyone follows the law of nature, state of war is when someone breaks it.

## Slavery

Can't enslave yourself because you don't own your life. But you can forfeit your life by violating the law of nature, and they can enslave you rather than killing you.

## Property

God gave the earth to men in common.

But if you had to ask every man before using the earth, no one would be able to use it.

Comes from a time when there was a lot of unused land. Cultivating previously unused land makes it 10-100x more productive, so not only does labor seem to be where the value comes from, but also "he that leaves as much as another can make use of, does as good as take nothing at all"--doesn't quite fit today.

## Parents

Parents don't have full dominion over their children. They have a duty to make some decisions for them before they understand the law of nature. Once children understand the law of nature, it's time for them to be independent.

Dominon over the parent does not mean dominion over the child, but if the child wants the inheritence from the parents, they must take that property with the strings that are attached (government). Parents incentivize, not force, children to stay within their govt.

## Marriage

Marital bonds should last at least as long as they're raising children becuase one must promote the survival of mankind.

## Civil Society

Is when people agree to give up their executive power.

The great chief end is preservation of property.

Reasons. In nature:
* No established, settled known law
* No known and indifferent judge
* Not always power to support a sentence

But you have to give up:
* Power of doing whatever you want
* Power of punishing

Government must be directed to no end but peace, safety, and public good.

This limitation means: Can't do more than any person could do. No man can transfer more power than he had himself


* Needs to dispense judgement based on standing laws and known judges
* Must be designed for good of people
* Can't take property without consent.
* Legislaive can't transfer its power to others

## Power

Nature gives paternal power to benefit parents

Voluntary agreement gives political power

And one can only gain despotic power over someone if they forfeit their rights through violating law of nature.

## Conquest

Only get power over those that actually tried to prevent your just war--they're the only ones who forfeited their rights.

Also, don't get power over their children or wives, and their children and wives have a right to the property to survive before you have a right for reparation

## Disolution of Government

The people can't take power away from the government once they give it up to them, but the government can forfeit it if they go beyond their right of looking out for people's wellbeing and such, in which case people are in their right to revolt.
