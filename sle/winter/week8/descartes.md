# Descartes

10 Nov 1619, Descarte had a dream. Altered the course of modern intellectual history.

## Dream(s)

Had a 3-part dream / 3 dreams:

### Nightmare

Terrified by phantoms, weakness in right side made him lurch left. Caught up in swirling wind. Trying to reach chapel of college. On his way, realzied he passed someone he knew, tries to go back. Then wind blows him toward the chapel, he decides not to go into chapel because he thinks there's an evil spirit. Someone else gives him a melon from foreign country.

Woke with pain in left side

### Nightmare

Loud clap of thunder. Awoke to room being filled with sparks. Wasn't sure if he was awake or asleep. Blinked a lot, made them go away

### 3rd

Began with vision of large book. (Encyclopedia/dictionary)

Opens poetry book, finds "what road in life should I follow?" in Latin. Someone hands him paper that says "it is and it's not" (in Latin).

Then book and man disappear. Then he decides in his sleep that it is a dream and starts interpretting it.

---

Takes 3rd dream as message from his future, first 2 as warning about the past.

The day before, he made important discovery that was relevant to general method for finding knowledge. (We don't know what)

Some think it was actually a nervous breakdown, dream gets us in that mindset.

Regardless, Descartes saw his time in Ulm where this happened as very important, conversion experience.

Made pilgrimage to Italy in thanksgiving.

## Effect

He translated this dream into a wholesale re-examination of human thought.

Dream is vision of a project. Driving force is spirit of truth (thunder) shaking him out of his old path to his new.

Life of the mind.

Not any ordinary life of scholarship. Encyclopedia = all sciences gathered together = unified science.

Sweep away the learning so far to clear the way for a carefully-planned science. Hang together organically--all closely interconnected. Each draws meaning from having a certain place in the whole thing.

Make sure that nothing contaminates--everything needs to be absolutely certain in itself or clear based on other things.

Knowledge = Tree: roots-metaphysics, trunk-physics, and branches of medicine, mechanics morals, then smaller branches off of those.

## Intellectual Europe of the time

Distinction between principles governing superlunary realm and sublunary.

superlunary--movement is supposed to be perfect and constant (keep going to the same place, carries certain kind of perfection, incorruptible).

sublunary--motion can have change, decay, corruption.

---

sublunary has natural places for the 4 elements (earth air fire water). Places tend to return to their natural places. (earth at center, then water, then air, then fire)

But things in subluary are mixed up, so things have unnatural, violent motion.

---

nature of the elements is to be understood based on fundamental qualities and essences

substantial for explains why the thing is the kind of thing that it is.

---

emphasized the importance of the senses in explaining how we know things.

"there is nothing in the intellect that was not first in the senses"

---

Something about aristotle and stuff

## Aristotle under pressure

Especially because of new results of the mathematical sciences. eg. Copernicus

No way to reconcile Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo with Aristotilean physics.

Galileo developed separate mathematical physics.

---

Descartes was first to figure out how to describe curves. (geometry)

Also derived Snell's Law.

## Cartesian vision

New science. Explain why Aristotlean isn't needead anymore.

This new science is mathematical in its method--organized like a mathematical theory.

Ultimate fruit--Newtonian physics. Simple laws of physics that explain both superlunary and sublunary.

---

One important feature of modernity is "scientific revolution". Mixed mathematical sciences had been making progress for a long time, but what was important is the philosophical idea that those are the centre of knowledge, rather than ancillary.

## Conclusion

Reason > senses. Identified some methods to help with reason. 1st meditation: skepticism helps you sweep away the city of prior knowledge.

Priviledge of mathematical knowledge as a model. Start from axioms and make immediately obvious small steps. Can supplement it with experience from the world, but look for experiments to identify which mechanism is producing our effect. Like heart example in part 5 of Discourse

Basic principles of metaphysics. 1st principle of knowledge is "I think therefore I am"--if you try to refute your existence, that refutes your refutation because you're thinking about your existence, so you must exist. Mind is distinct from body.

Training manual to learn to use intellectual insight. Meditations preface: if you're not going to meditate with me seriously, don't bother. Aim is to give you direct insight. In meditation, he's careful not to present the cogito as an argument. Wants you to have direct insight that you must exist.

6th part of the discourse reads like a grand app. Promises that this new science will make us masters and possessors of nature. Not just a theoretical mastery, but a practical.
