# Locke: Second Treatise of Government

Deborah Satz. *Why some things should not be for sale*

Defense of private ownership, relationship between private ownership and organization of the state.

17th century.

Whole world was organized around kings. Relations between people were fixed--no social mobility.

Lived in a world of radical inequality, was theorist of radical equality. Makes sense--developed alternative to the world he saw.

His views about equality are important to understanding. Takes it as a premise and a constraint.

Constraint: sets limits to what government can do. Govt can't enslave people or deprive people of resources they need to be free.

Equality is inherent.

The equality is abstract; each of us has an equal right to be free. No one is born into a morally superior or inferior position. No one is born to rule and no one is born to serve.

Thus, in no way should any natural difference (height, intelligence, etc) can give rise to social differences (authority). Pre-social

Attack on divine right of kings.

Fillmer (main opponent) and others thought that if you don't think authority is social, not natural, there's no solid foundation. Because we may disagree on social arrangements. Knocking out the divine right sets you on the way to anarchy.

*Second Treatise* goes to disprove this--shows how you can get a government without natural authority.

## Fillmer

Fillmer thought God gave the world to Adam and his descendants. And the direct line of Adam is the kings.

Locke says that this is a misreading of scripture. God gave the world to Adam **and Eve**. Since he gave it to *them*, "they" isn't one person, so it must be all the people.

Lockean provison--God gave the earth to humanity in common to use. This puts a limit on how much property one can accumulate--can't own the whole earth based on that.

Fillmer said common sense morality was that vertical relationships based on birth were natural. Instead, people are equals.

Locke said that they were wrong about inequality based on the bible and in other ways.

He was tried for sedition. Escaped.

## Big Ideas

On the basis of an assumption that by nature we're all free, equal, rational, Locke can show that only 1 form of govt is legitimate.

* Based on the authority of the people.
* We delegate the govt to act in our name. But govt's authority is not absolute. Must respect some individual rights, tolerate religious diversity, protect common good. Or it loses authority.
* It is the people's decision whether it's still legit. Revolution is a right.

### Puzzle

Defends const. democracy, but also defends theory with significant social and economic equality.

Defends disproportionate and unequal possession of the earth. (Graf 50) 

Thinks the govt is a *property-owners' state*. Property qualifications on voting. Only those who own a certain amount of property can vote and run for office.

Thus, we still get a system where only the propertied classes can vote and hold office.

Can we get a more democratic system based on Lockean assumptions?

As it is, he puts enormous scope to economic inequality and limits what the government can do to prevent it.

No taxation without consent--can't be taxed unless you personally consent to pay the tax.

### Pieces and Building Blocks

Imagine government that would be chosen in a state of nature.

#### State of nature

No political authority.

Even without political authority:

* Governed by natural law. Moral requirements on you. Based on the idea that people have claims on you and that you have on people that are inherent to you as a human. Legislated by God, but also follow from the fact that we can reason. Says to will peace and preservation of mankind.
* We're equally free. Power can only be exercised over us with our consent.
* There are natural rights. Freedom, self-preservation, executive (to punish), property.

Under those conditions, what would we agree to?

Locke abstracts away from strength/individual differences by saying everyone has equal right to be free.

### Right of property

Even without govt, we must have some right to own things because we have to survive. The right of appropriation comes in part from labor--mix your labor with the land you cultivate. When my servant works the land, it doesn't become his because I already owns it.

Even without govt, the amount we'd appropriate would be unequal because we do have unequal abilities despite being equal and free. We owned things before govt, so when forming a govt, we'd still own unequal things.

But there's a limit on appropriation--Lockean proviso. Can't spoil parts of the earth--only take what you can use. But money doesn't rot, so that allows for a lot more inequality. But you can't horde so much that people can't have access to the earth to survive because 1st law of nature says you must will the preservation of mankind.

Because ownership is a right, it limits the authority of govt--we don't give up our rights when we join a society without our consent. 

Why does mixing your labor generate property rights? We have property within ourselves (which means we can't be owned), and labor mixes those into the property. But why? Why don't you just lose the labor?

Government is illegitimate when it tries to get rid of the social inequality. Can't tax people to promote equality because that violates property rights. Only can if the taxed consent.

## Questions

### What is the point of Locke's government?

State of nature can be come state of war due to lack of common rules (-> conflict). This makes things unsecure.

You have private goals, and the state helps you achieve those private goals by preventing conflict.

That's the only reason you quit the state of nature.

Government's goal is to improve everyone from where they were in the state of nature.

### Is poverty the fault of the poor?

Some claim Locke thinks the poor are irrational and lazy. Violate the state of nature by not seeking their preservation. But probably not optimal interpretation.

Alternatively, people have different capacities which generate unequal ability to succeed. But does say "God has given the earth not to the insolent and lazy but to the virtuous and hard-working.

Since you don't own yourself (God owns us), you can't kill yourself or sell yourself.

---

There are strong and weak rights. You can turn over weak rights to the state (like the right to punish those that violate natural law). Can't turn over right to own property.

Can also forfeit some rights (like if you try to kill someone, you lose your rights).

Althought Locke is extremely religious, religion can't be the sole basis of authority. Religious conviction must be internal.
