# Enlightenment

More and more people were thinking about philosophy.

Enlightenment was not when people started to think differently, but when people started to think differently about how others were thinking.

Why it should have started in England:
* Lots of philosophy and science
* 

But didn't, partially due to Glorious Revolution.

Those we associate with the Enlightenment have more in common with the ancient then moderns.

Happened in France becuase they were debating so accutely their own time.

Enlightenment was largely state-sponsored.
