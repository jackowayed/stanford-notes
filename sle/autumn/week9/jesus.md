Questions about Yeshua:
* What was his message?
* How did he preach it?
* What was the outcome?
* Who was he?

Didn't live in Jerusalem, the sophisticated capital. He was up in rural, poor norther area near Sea of Galilee

Going to Jerusalem, especially at Passover time, guaranteed his death. Would have been fine if he stayed up north. But Romans were oppressing the Jews, so being called king of the Jews is bad. May have been intentional.

Quelle (Q) -- earliest source, ~50CE (20 years after death). Already was tweaked to speak to the modern audience better.

Next came Paul's epistles

Gospel order: Mark, {Matthew, Luke}, John

John is only one that declares him divine, having always existed.

90% of Mark's stories are found in Matt, 50% found in Luke.

The remainder comes from a common source (Greek words are exactly the same for one story)--Q

Then they also both added their own material

Radical change in Yeshua's message between his death and the writings. He pointed to the kingdom of god, and he was dispensible. But the church redirected that to him.

Yeshua's message in Galilee: didn't preach himself, preached the power of God.

Message: The power of God is at hand if you want it.

Repent, meaning "change your life completely"

Yeshua preached non-apocalyptic reign of God **now** (wanting people to radically change their life)

This was turned into apocalyptic in-break in the very near future where kingdom comes down from heaven.

(How) was Yeshua resurrected?

3 essentials for ressurrection:

* Empty tomb
* Risen body
* Tangible Appearance
