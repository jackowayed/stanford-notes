# Paul

Kirsti!!

Can't understand the Bible without looking at it as an outsider *and* insider.

Paul, in some ways, is more significant than Gospel of Mark for development of Christianity.

Paul's letters are from the 40's and 50's--before any Gospel.

Big question--do Gentiles need to convert to Judaism to follow Jesus? Paul says no.

One reason he won: Gentiles preferred his idea, especially since circumcision was periodically illegal in the Roman empire.

Also, Paul was a very good writer.

Relatively well-educated. (Whereas 85-90% were illiterate)

Doesn't characterize self as great preacher.

Was Jew, Jewish parents.

Very zealous for law.

Pharisee:
* Messianic
* Apocalyptic
  * Resurrection

Persecuted the church

Had problems with Jesus.
* Died (doesn't fit the messiah Paul wanted)

Paul is still a Jew; still messianic, apocalypitc, waiting for ressurrection

## Romans

~57-58 CE

The Gospel in Romans:
* generosity of God
* complete freedom
* eternal life.

Reasons he's writing it:
* Get $ for mission
* Spread his gospel
* Clarify his position

Some say Paul is responsible for anti-Judaism (Holocaust, etc) because he rejected Judaism

Alan Segal--Paul the Convert--wanted to unify gentiles & Jews

John Gager--Remember that Paul is speaking to, about, etc. the gentiles.

Gager would say that Paul saw 2 ways to salvation: Jesus for gentiles, the law for Jews

Romans 1:26-27 (but start at 18): The only anti-homosexual passage in the New Testament
* One explanation: Starting with 18, it's really against pagan idolatry. The homosexuality is the punishment (God gives them the "degrading passions" as punishment for idols)
* Another: Women trading "natural intercourse for unnatural" might just mean them reject the "natural" idea of them being passive, men active
