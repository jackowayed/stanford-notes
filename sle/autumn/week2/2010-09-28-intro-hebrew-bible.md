# Intro to the Hebrew Bible

Professor Mark Mancall

No such thing as the Hebrew bible.

Written in Hebrew and Aramaic.

## 3 parts

* Torah: best translated as "teachings"--the 5 books of Moses. 
* Prophets: Judges through something
* Writings

A lot of literature is excluded: ex the "nostic" (sp?) literature

Has inumerable authors, and everyone that reads it interprets it.

Not a book of theology, not a book of history.

There are people in the world that don't know the bible exists.

Was not the central book of the Jewish tradition historically. This was the least important of 3 types of texts originally--less important than Tahlmud (sp?) (primary document of Jewish education, based on questions, ex. "What is a found object?") and stories (attempt at rationally expaining stories in the bible, continues to be written to this day).

2 versions of the Torah--the written first 5 books of Moses and the oral text that God told to Moses on Mount Sinai, just as long and important.

First mention that might refer to the 5 books of Moses (it was to "the teachings of Moses") is in Ezra 3. 

God does not create out of nothing, earth starts "unformed and void", but it's there. He creates with breath ("wind"--same word in Hebrew) and by speaking.

Breath and blood are both closely associated with life in the bible.

Adam means "man", comes from word for "earth"

Cain and Abel presents theme: 2 different ways of life--tilling soil, nomadically raising livestock.

Ex. "Land of milk & honey"--milk comes from livestock, honey comes from farmers.

No word for sin in Hebrew.

No hell in the Torah--closest to it is a valley outside of Jerusalem where lepers live.

Nor heaven.

God condems Cain to become a nomad (like Abel was) by saying the soil won't yield its strength to him.

Genesis 9:6--"Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that persons blood be shed" yet Genesis is super-bloody.

Abram = "The Great Father"

Abram goes up along the Tigris to southern Turkey and then down the coast (that's grassland).

## How this book can be used for social insight

Story of Joseph & his brothers

Joseph institutes feudalism. Could have just helped people without requiring them to give up their land and tie themselves to it.

Israelites may have become slaves because Joseph set the precedent.

## Fun story from Judges

This was a stateless society--no king in Israel.

Guy had a concubine, she decided to go home to her mother. Eventually guy gets impatient, goes to get her. Father delays their leaving as much as possible.

They end up in/very near Jerusalem. No one invites him in, eventually someone does. In the middle of dinner, people want to rape the man. The host offers his daughters instead, eventually the man offers concubine instead.

He finds his concubine lying on the doorstep the next morning. Takes her home, hacks her up into 12 pieces, sends a piece to each of the 12 tribes. War ensues.

This is the story of Lot retold.
