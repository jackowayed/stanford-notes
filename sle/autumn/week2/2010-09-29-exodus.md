# Exodus

Professor Charlotte E. Fonrobert

Ways to look at the bible:

* historical
  * What really happened
  * history of the literature--how it came to be as a book
* theological
* literary

1:8-9 first appearance of "am benei Yisrael" = "Israelite people"

Ilana Pardes--literature scholar. Suggests that the birthing imagery at the beginning of Exodus is to illustrate the birth of the nation of Israel.

Moses' birth parallels the birth of Israel.

Abraham in Genesis 12 came from somewhere else, just as "Israel" in Exodus came from Egypt.

autochtonous = "stemming from the earth". Many indiginous peoples have autochtonous founding myths

Emphasis on firstborn.
