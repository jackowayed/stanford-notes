# Aeneid

### Rome = the World

Ovid, 15 CE: "The extent of the Roman city is also the extent of the world"

St. Jerome, 410: "In a single city, the whole world perished"

The Aeneid said "On them [the Romans] I set no limits, space or time/ I have granted them power, empire without end". Not so much, Virgil.

We don't know of a single Roman author who was from Rome.

## Repeated motifs

Civil wars is a common motif, as it was in Roman history.

Book 1.386 Jupiter prophesizes an end to the pattern

Refoundation: 3.102-105, 3.114-117

Trojan War redux: 6.103-106, 7.376-377

Aeneid a rerun of the Iliad? The poetics of repetition. Dido has Aeneas retell story of Trojan War, Book 4 96-98

Aeneasa asks Anchises (6.831-834)

In Anchinses' 2nd (historical) speech, Augustus (6.909-931) and Caesar (6.951-961) occur out of chronological order.

Lots of cosmic imagery on coins of Casear and Octavian.
