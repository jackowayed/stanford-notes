## Cultural Background

### Origin Myth: Romulus & Remus

8th century BCE. Vestal virgin had an affair with/was raped my Mars. Had twins.

They were put in the river Aneo(sp??), survived

Discovered by a wolf, suckled them.

Then shepherd raised them as his own.

They were so awesome that it was clear that they had royal lineage. Needed a kingdom, had none. Decided to found a city.

Asked the deities which should be king.

Remus got 6 vultures, and then Romulus got 12. Each was soluted as king by his own party. (Because Remus got his first, but Romulus got more)

Romulus dug the outline of his walls. Remus said that that's bs, jumped over the furrows, Romulus struck him dead. "So shall it be to anyone who breaches my walls"

4/21/753 BCE.

Romulus needed more people, allowed anyone to come, got lots of people, but they were cutthroats, escaped slaves, thieves, etc. Also, mostly male.

Tried to establish intermarriage with nearby tribes, they said no.

"Rape of the Sabine Women"--Romans set up a feast with neighboring tribes, including Sabines. Sabines showed up with wives & daughters. After they had a lot of wine, Romans kidnapped the Sabine women. Have children with them.

Sabines keep mounting attacks to try to get their women back. Looks like they'll destroy each other, but the women step in, make piece.

---

7 kings to start Rome

### 509 BCE--Explusion of Tarquinius Superbus (king)

His son thinks he can do anything, rapes a Roman noblewoman. So they kick out the king

Kings were also Etruscan.

Romans HATE the word king (rex)

Government: 2 consuls (executive), Senate (deliberative), citizen voting assemblies (pass laws, elect magistrates)

### 3 classes

Patricians--nobles, they hold office

--knight/merchant class. Well off, good terms with patricians.

Plebians--start untouchable, slowly get more infranchised

### Early Republic

Domestic: gradual enfranchisement of plebians

Foreign policy: expansion

### Middle Republic

First overseas war.

Carthage and Greece were conspiring, had to fight.

bellum pium et iustum--"obligatory and just war"

### Late Republic

Romans have conquered tons of territory

Massive influx of wealth from conquered territories, distributed unequally. (Military leaders, powerful people, etc)

Leads to rise of a few immensely powerful oligarchs

Competition among oligarchs for access to politcal offices that allow acquisition of wealth & power

Eventually, use of wealth to purchase private armies...

... then use of private armies, loyal to leaders (NOT to Rome), to compete with fellow oligarchs: civil war

## Literary History Before the Aeneid 

### Alexandrian Tradition

Library of Alexandria->Scholarly study of literature

Basic tendencies:

* learned poet
* studied, constant, poetry; sly allusion to other texts
* irreverent
* aetiological-about causs & origins
* "slender muse"--no extra words

Romans are heirs to this tradition.

Livius Andronicus--freed slave, translates the *Odyssey* into Latin
