# What is the Socratic Method?

Professor Rob Reich, Political Science Department

No black & white

David Brooks--*The Organization Kid*. Elite university students suck at independent thought. Like hoops to jump through because with enough work you know you'll succeed.

Ex. If programs at a university aren't getting enough enrollment, limit the spots, require an application and such, more people apply.

Philosophy makes you more excited about question-asking (and then pursuing the answer).

John Dewey: ~= "Asking the right question about a problem is an answer of a sort"

Advice: asked a question you can't answer in class, respond by providing a better question to ask.

Clip of *The Paper Chase* (about law school): Prof asks questions of random students, they must answer with info from the reading.

That's NOT the Socratic method. More "cold calling".

## Actual Lecture

"Socrates was a philosopher who went around asking lots of questions, and for his efforts the Greeks put him to death."

Unusually, Socrates' legacy isn't substance (acutal philosophy), but process (Socratic method).

Characteristic:

* Activity of philosophizing
* Questioning
* Elenchus (refutation/crossexamination)
* Inspiring aporia (curiosity)
* Moral education
* Egalitarian attitude
* Teaching as midwifery

### Activity of philosophizing

He doesn't instruct them on philosophy (lecture), but participates.

It's not wisdom going teacher->student, it's common inquiry where all participants follow it and think for themselves.

No passive receptivity. Knowledge is not ours until we've established it for ourselves.

Excerpt from "Death of Ivan Ilich": Ivan can understand "Chais a man, men are mortal, so Chais is mortal", but only in the abstract. Not his own mortality.

### Questioning

Asks question after question, often with no conclusion, no answer at the end.

### Elenchus

Questions are asked to refute/crossexamine.

Aims to shame them into a recognition that their beliefs are false, in need of more thinking and refinement.

Cleanses people of the false beliefs that clutter their reason. Renders them aware that they don't have answers.

Destructive, in order that common inquirty (construction) may follow.

Usually asks them questions that force them to contradict themselves, showing that their beliefs are flawed.

### Aporia (Confusion)

The questions make them confused (because they realize that what they thought was right isn't).

Gets them to admit their ignorance and saves them from the false belief. Knowing than ignorant is better than not realizing it.

The aporia is therapeutic--they seek the right answers in the end.

### Moral Education

Doesn't question facts or hypotheticals.

Always operates ad hominem.

Aim is to test the beliefs held by the person.

Insists that people say what they think.

Aims for moral education/improvement by showing people that they're living their lives with flawed morals.

Before: interlocutar is contently unaware of their flawed beliefs. After: They realize it, must seek unflawed beliefs.

### Egalitarian Attitude

Conversed with esteemed men, young boys, slaves--all welcome.

No intellectual or societal prereqs.

### Teaching as Midwifery

Characterizes his method as being a midwife--**asists in the birth of knowledge, but has no hand in the actual production**.

Idea that souls already have all knowledge, education just draws it out of them.

### Further Reflection

No more ironic lecture about Socratic Method--shifting to Socratic discussion about what obligations we have to the global poor.

Uses Peter Singer's solution to poverty.

Knowing what's morally correct but not doing it is what religions call evil.
