# How it Begins

*The Theogony* by Hesiod (Genesis of the Gods)

Richard Martin, Classics

Every time you get a myth, someone's telling it for a purpose.

Ask yourself who's gaining from that view of reality.

There were many bards, each with their own versions of the myths.

One could compose in performance--they used repeatable segments like "cloud-gathering Zeus" that could be put together on the fly.

These aren't dogma--they're different each day, and there's no blasphemy if you make stuff up.

Origin story of the universe is framed in story of how Hesiod got the story from muses. And muses could have lied to him.

Creation myths--either architectural or automatic.

Architectural: Zuni: Being is alone, creates the earth. Architectural because he shapes the earth, thinks about it, etc. Like genesis.

Automatic: Hesiod: Chaos ("the gap"), out of it arises earth, earth makes sky (husband) and sleeps with him. Also Orpheus: earth hatched from "world egg". cf. Egyptian, Indic, Chinese egg traditions.

## Hesiod

Gaia (Earth) marries Ouranos (Sky), have a bunch of kids.

Ouranos is having continual sex with Gaia, so some babies are "born" but can't get out of Gaia because of the sex. So then Kronos gets a sickle and cuts off Ouranos' genitals. They're cast aside and foam, turn into Aphrodite.

Kronos and Rhea have a bunch of kids. Zeus and Demeter have Persephone, Zeus and Hera have 3 kids, Hera has Hephaistos alone. Zeus, Demeter, and Hera are all siblings.

Koios and Phoibe (both kids of Gaia and Ouranos) have a kid.

Kronos lets the kids be born, then eats all the kids. But Zeus (youngest) lives because Rhea gives him a stone instead, which makes him vomit the other kids. Zeus sends Kronos to the edge of the world (doesn't kill).

Zeus learns that if he marries Metis, their kid will be stronger than him. So he marries her and then eats her. He gets a headache, Hephaistos hits him with an axe on the head to fix it, Athena comes out.

Zeus possesses all the cunning intelligence.

Nymphs and giants--Titans are underground and are like boiling energy that wants to rebel (connected to volcanoes). Nymphs are on the surface and can make you drown. Political.

Hesiod likes 2's and 3's. 2's=opposition (day and night). 3's = totality (3 seasons,

Power--Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus. Like past, present, future, which is why Zeus is most powerful. Like the tyrants that were around at the time.

For whose good is the Theogony? Hesiod goes to the palaces of tyrants and sings of the rightness of the power structure and such. Gets him money.

### Psychology of the Stories

A lot of mother v. father, son v. father (often son helping mother v. father). Greek neurosis based on mother's fear of the powerful father.

### In context of the region

It's easy to get one side of the Aegean to the other--and to Iran, etc--quickly.

Many of these concepts were already there long before in Babylonian myths and others from the area.

Return of Kronos: Roman Saturnalia (slaves were waited on by masters) -> X-mas and New Years. Kronos was marginalized by Zeus (sent to edge of world), he comes back for a few days for Saturnalia, then goes back.

The figure of the old year with sickle is Kronos.
