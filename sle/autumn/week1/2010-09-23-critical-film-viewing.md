# Critical Film Viewing

Greg Watkins

We're in a visual era now. 

Motion pictures started at Stanford. Just past FroSoCo near the tennis courts.

Film: sequence of images in a single take.

Elements of film:

* **mise-en-scene**: theatre term. It's everything the audience sees. What's onstage, where stuff is, costume, lighting, staging, how they move, rhythm
* cinematography: the lens and such, speed of motion, how the camera moves in relation to the set (panning, zooming, etc)
* shot-to-shot editing: Greg thinks editing is the essential aspect of film. Films juxtapose different images against each other.
* sound

Kuleshov filmed neutral face of actor. Alternated that shot and then random stuff. Soup, girl playing, etc. People watched it and thought the actor perfectly portrayed emotions related to the images.
