# Ancient Greece

European universities from long ago didn't like Greece much. They weren't too keen on democracy, liked their established church, etc.

In the 19th century, people started identifying more as Europeans (with roots back to ancient Greece), rather than Christians or townspeople or countrypeople like before. 

Europeans also started believing that they are superior to everyone else because they descend from the ancient Greeks.

Also started getting the idea that kings aren't divinely appointed and getting rid of them.

Universities taught Greek & Latin in depth as part of this.

Classics thus become pervasive in Western culture.

"Greece is good to think with"--wildly different society, but similar problems that we have today.

Socrates and Plato weren't too into democracy

Early on, only reason to do what someone tells you to is if they hvae knowledge that you don't. Many people claimed special access to the gods to achieve this.

Homer's poetry had the idea of kings and such being beloved by the gods, then Hesiod had a little, and soon after it was gone.

Starting around Homer's time (8th century BCE), temples come around. People start worshipping there instead of in rich people's houses. The houses become more alike.

Greek city states were tiny. Athens was biggest at 1000 square miles, 300k people

Athenian intellectuals all new each other really well.

After kings, went to having a small aristocracy of well-educated people.

Peasants started putting pressure on the aristocrats. They tried to play the "I'm just like you" card.

Very harsh, competitive world.

Only 31/1000 city states signed up to fend off the Persian invaders. Democratic tendencies helped.
