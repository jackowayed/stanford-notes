# Orestia

Rush Rehm

written by Aescylusd in 458 BCE

Only surviving trilogy.

Greek tragedy developed at the same time as democracy

(Both were really more Athenian than Greek as a whole)

Orestia is theatrically interesting.

Agamemnon is large scale.

## Clytemnestra

Only character in all 3 plays

Dominates Agamemnon

Victim in Coifri

Appearance spurs the furies on towards vengeance

Prompts question "What am I to do?" by Orestes, big moral question.

### monologues

#### 1

Insight into what it must be like for the Trojans. Death, pilaging, rape, slavery.

Realizes that Greek army is ravenous.

They must be careful how they act--spare the temples, honor gods.

Long trek home (correct: storm ends up destroying all but Agamemnon's ship)

#### 2

Welcomes husband home.

First, talks about what it was like to wait--rumors, bad news.

Motif of sleep(lessness) shows up

Overwhelmingly praises him.

Then spreads tapestries. "The wealth of the house to be trampled"

#### 3

Unabashed--admits that she lied and deceived. Now can tell the truth--that the murder of Agamemnon is a triumphant moment of celebration.

Blood "like spring rain on seeds watering them into life". Agamemnon's blood gave her life

Agamemnon killed her innocent daughter when he could have killed many men.

Also killed him because she has a lover Aegysthus.

Said she took erotic delight in the death of Casandra.

Something primal
