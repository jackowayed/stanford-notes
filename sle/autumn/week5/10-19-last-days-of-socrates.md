# Last Days of Socrates

Marsh McCall, Classics

Socrates was the ugliest man in Athens. Built like a lineman. "Tank"

Very patriotic. Almost never left Athens, save on military duty.

Fighter of uncommon valor. Everyone wanted to fight with him, be tentmate, etc.

Upper classes of Greek world were bisexual in general.

Older men would "educate" younger men in the ways of sexual love--Eros.

So not only did everyone want to be his tentmate, they wanted to be his "tentmate".

He was also though to be the most beautiful man in Athens due to valor, principles, etc.

Socrates "educated" Alcibiades.

Socrates spent last 30 years talking to whoever would in the public spaces of Athens, especially the Agora (marketplace).

Discussed how to lead a good life, be virtuous, etc.

arete = virtue/goodness/excellence. Want to do everything you do with arete. Socrates helped people examine their lives and construct them to be arete-ful.

Socrates never wrote anything down--wouldn't have gotten tenure

We mostly know stuff because of Plato.

## Socratic Doctrines

* The unexamined life is not worth living. Eg. p. 66, line 38a
* The first and necessary toward wisdom: know one's ignorance.
* Arete is teachable => arete is knowledge (Thus, everyone can be rehabbed)
* No one does harm intentionally

bottom 44, bottom 46--ex. of 2nd doctrine

bottom 50--ex. of 3rd doctrine (?) and 4th (25e-26a)

Explanation of 4th: By harming others, you harm yourself (not arete). So when harm occurs, it's only because of ignorance to that fact.

## The Apology

Apolgia in Greek means defense speech.

Does Socrates actually want to get acquitted? Is this a serious defense speech?

## Plato

Plato felt Socrates was wronged by the jury.

Kept his teachings on through writing.

Plato hated democracy because he saw what happened to Socrates due to the marjority opinion.

## Apology / Crito

muops = gadfly
