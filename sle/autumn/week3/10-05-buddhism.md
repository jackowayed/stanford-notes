# Buddhism

Professor Mark Mancall

Some scholar says of memorization (of like entire texts) that it's good because then the text is in your head forever, so you can think about it whenever, talk about it whenver, etc. without having to look it up.

Buddhism is not a religion.

"I live in a Buddhist country, and I have no better idea of what Buddhism is than someone living on the moon."

It's more like a culture. It's hard to separate Buddhism from the culture of Buddhist countries.

Buddhism is meant to be taught orally. The texts are really just notes to a teacher saying what to teach about in what order.

There is no "Buddhist bible".

Time is not a factor--there are still texts being discovered **and written** that are just as valid as older ones. Buddhism is an "ever-renewing tradition".

No word for Buddhism in Tibetan. There is a word for a *Buddhist* though.

*The Little Buddha* is an awful movie.

Lotus = enlightenment

## Buddha's Life

Buddha's mom gets impregnated by a white elephant (which = royal) in a dream. He's born able to walk, walks in every direction, Lotuses sprout under each step.

Prophecy that he'll be a great king or a great teacher. Parents want him to be a king because teachers are poor.

They build a perfect garden (sick people, people > 30, etc. aren't allowed in) for him with a wall around it so he won't discover stuff about the world.

He realizes that there's stuff beyond the world, finds out about illness, aging, death, teachers.

Tries total aestheticism for 6 years, realizes that's too extreme.

Goes to wash his face, hear's someone tuning an instrument--first too high, then too low, then right. Realizes that it's the same idea--he needs to find the middle way between total deprivation and lavishness.

Then someone offers him milk as a purely selfless act, which he finds interesting.

Meditates under a tree for a long time. Is tempted by lots of material stuff. Awakens at midnight and understands balance, wisdom, compassion.

Spends the next 35 years wandering the Gangedic plane. Gets disciples. All male until his aunt/"milk mother" tries to join. He says no for awhile, eventually he accepts. Women in Buddhism is still a big issue.

Sits under bannana tree due to monsoons.

The next year, they build a shack--early monestary. "Rains retreat", for a few months a year must stop wandering and sit down together.

Fragmentation occurred becuase people all remembered different things they thought he said. 400 years later many monks got together and came to an agreement on what Buddha actually said. Also formed a university which lasted until the Muslims came to India.

Buddha was not a vegetarian, died of food poisoning from undercooked pork.

## Spread

Ashoka, who was a great warrior and thus raped an pillaged and murdered a lot. One day asked why they were doing it, especially since someday he'll die and lose all the wealth. Became Buddhist, did lots of good stuff. Sent son and daughter to Sri Lanka to teach. Monks spread from there to SE Asia and Indonesia.

Buddhism spread to China through trade. Need to translate the texts, so they formed committees to translate (so that they can discuss how to translate it).

## Two Forms

* Theravada-"The wisdom of the elders" Lacks a great deal of the ritual in the other kind.
* Mahayana-Very magical, sensual, sexual. aka "tantric"

### Mahayana

Spread to China, Japan, Tibet.

#### Subset: Vajrayana.

Practiced in Himalaya (Tibet, etc). Most monastic.

4 major schools. Most "magical" and also the one with most focus on texts (very intellectual) is what the Dalai Lama belongs to.

## Four Noble Truths

Wisdom that Buddha acquired at midnight under bodi tree.

1. Truth of Suffering: Suffering exists. Life is a process of suffering, whether we know it or not.
2. Truth of Arising: Suffering arises from attachment to desires. (Because you want something you can't have, like immortality. Shouldn't even desire enlightment)
3. Truth of Cessation: Suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases.
4. Truth of the Path: Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the eightfold path.

## Eight-fold Path

1. Right Understanding
2. Right Resolve (thought)
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Meditation.

Mancall wanted to be a hitman. That would not be "Right Livelihood".

Meditation simple means single-mindedness, concentrating all of your being on something. Don't have to go sit under a tree.

From the Buddhist perspective, ultimately never exists. Everything is transient. Each day everything is a little different.

"We have technology now that will make it as painful as possible for you to die."

I don't exist either. People are just constructions. Ex. if you take apart a car, you have lots of parts, but not a car anymore.

## Buddha's Three Bodies

All look exactly the same--just about perspective.

* Nirmanakaya--earthly body that he walked around with. Perfectly normal human. Nothing surreal.
* Sambhogakaya--"heavenly body" in paradise. In popular Buddhism of the peasants, nonexistence is hard to fathom, so when you die you go to one of many paradises, each of which has a Buddha. Objectively, these paradises don't exist.
* Dharmakaya--identical with ultimate truth. The original state of all things (though the real original state of all things is nonexistence)

## Reincarnation

"The issue is not being reborn but redying."

Idea is that some form of your consciousness (not your soul or your mind) is captured and reborn.

We have the ability to stop it if we are sufficiently enlightened.

When Buddhists die, they generally are burned, but if they really are detached from their body, they may be carried up a mountain, cut up, and left as food for birds. No issue with this is if you're not connected to your body.

Insistence on originality is interesting, as if innovation and originality are a substitute for wisdom.

"The reward of a good life is the good life."
