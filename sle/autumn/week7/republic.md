# The Republic

Euthyphro, other Platonic dialogues have 2 important qualities.

* aporetic - confusion, no way out
* elenctic - What is X? Interlocutor gives definition, Socrates then gets them in contradiction

Definition = necessary + sufficient conditions for what you're defining

Philosophers mean exactly what they say

Book 4, 445a answers the question of the Republic ("Life does not seem worth living when the body's natural constitution is ruined")
