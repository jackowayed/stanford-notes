# Symposium

Joshua Landy

6 steps on ladder of love

## Summary

6 steps:

* Love individual body
* Love all beautiful bodies
* Love beautiful souls
* Love knowledge (Beauty of souls has same essence beauty of knowledge, laws, customs)
* Love beauty itself
* Devout entire life to beauty

The form of beauty exists in another world. Not this world because our world is imperfect.

This wolrd just has certain instances of beauty that are beautiful to some people.

Before you're born, you're a soul in the world of the forms, get to see the forms. We can identify beauty because we've seen it when we were souls.

Nothing we in our world see is truly beautiful. It just shares in beauty.

Difference between knowledge and correct belief is the ability to give a reason. If you just happen to guess the right answer, you can't justify it. We want knowledge.

## Summary^2

The forms are the perfect archetypes of things here. We saw them before we became embodied, so we can remember their essence.

Through this love stairstep, we get to see the forms face-to-face again.

What's wrong with this summary?

No Plato character in the Symposium. Some claim that Socrates expresses his views.

Not totally off--Socrates couldn't have said everything that he said in the Symposium.

But if Socrates were just Plato's spokesman, that would be weird, especially since Socrates doesn't even get the last word.

Instead, there are levels of irony that distance the text from Plato's actual beliefs.

3 types of irony in the Symposium:

* Socratic: say one thing, mean the opposite. #16
* Say one thing, it's not clear what you mean, maybe you dont mean anything. #18 (P.S. First recorded case of "It's not you, it's me")
* Hiding behind someone else. (Give someone else's view so you don't have to give your view.)

### Socrates contradicts himself

Premise: A: Desire implies lack - if A desires X, A lacks X (19) (NO: not necessarily)

Premis B: Love is desire for beauty. (NO: #25)

Love lacks beauty

Love is ugly (NO: false dichotomy)

Premise C: Whatever is good is also beautiful

Whatever is beautiful is good (NO: converse is not necessarily true)

Love is desire for good

Love lacks goodness

---

Socrates said just before that "love is continued possession", so desire doesn't have to come from lack.

Love is creating beauty. Premise B is gone. #25

Socrates says that beautiful vs. ugly is a false dichotomy.

"This is a logical trainwrenck"

---

"It is not hard at all to challenge Socrates" #21. Message from Plato. Challenge Socrates! Contradict him! With himself!

### Socrates is contradicted

Socrates agrees that you won't love someone bad, save by mistake. This is the preimse for the staircase argument

There's no room in that for "weakness of the will"--doing something that you know is not optimal for you.

Alcibiades disproves the idea that as soon as you know what you should do, you'll do it. #28

---

Plato would agree

* That aim of education is virtue
* Knowledge, ability to reason are crucially important
* The forms exist

## Speculative Hypothesis

Examined life: subjected to rational scruitiny.

Related to the knowledge vs. correct belief thing, the examined life is a life for which you can give reasons.

Have to get good at making arguments, exposing underlying assumptions to do this.

Can't get wisdom by emulating wise people or constantly listening to the wise. #42

This dialogue is to try to make us get active at examining our lives.
