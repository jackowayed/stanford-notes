# Song of Songs

May be a collection of poems, not just one.

But we've always had it as one manuscript, not several.

May have been written by Solomon, but no on can definitively date the text or determine author.

Dream-like quality.

Different than other books because:

* erotic explicitness
* God absent
* [people] Israel ?
* female perspective

Phyllis Trible of gender in it:

* back and forth/no dominance
* Genesis 3:16 is rejected in 2:16 "My beloved is mine and I am his". Word for desire only shows up in Genesis 3:16 and a few places in SoS.

Allegorical reading justifies it being in the cannon.

Shulamite = female = Israel/Church

King = male = god/Christ

SoS is read on Passover--receiving the 10 commandments is like receiving marriage contract; walking through the Red Sea is like sex.

Prophetic metahpor is of marriage (between Israel + God) gone awry, so SoS fills the gap by reigniting the relationship erotically.
