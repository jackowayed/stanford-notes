# The Odyssey

Homeric poetry likely started being performed by illiterate bards.

Early 50's, people in Crete composed epics about WWII.

Mnemosina (sp?) = memory (of the muses)

Memory creates all art in ancient greek culture.

Many Greek words are cognates, don't have the w sound that those in other langs do. But to make meter work, you need those w sounds. So the Odyssey comes from a form of Greek even ancient-er than Homer.

## Scenes where memory is central theme

### p. 10-11

Phemius sings about people returning from Troy, Odysseus not. Penelope tells him to sing something else

Audience of poem is "enraptured"--poetry = power.

Telemacus got one fact wrong, Athena, not Zeus, is responsible.

Books 1-4 = The Telemachy

### p. 58-59

Telemacus goes on mini-Odyssey to discover if his father is alive.

Listening to a story of Menalaus about how he got back

Athena has been dishonored, so she forced the initial wandering.

### p. 50-52

Stories are about their tellers.

Telemacus draws us in because he's like us--young, etc.

## 89-90

Odysseus is remembering

Wants to see the smoke rising from his hearth

He could have lived wih Calypso (hot nymph) for the rest of his life, and hopefully be immortal.

Odysseus may have remembered guy who became immortal but didn't get immortal youth, turned into cicada/grasshopper.

Finds girl, makes sure she's not a goddess, she likes her.

## Book 8 Demodocus songs

Please audience and O.

About Trojan horse, 2 other things.

In books 1-4 memory is painful, 5-8 it's pleasurable.

## 9-12

Framing question: how much is true? Story is told by O.

Only cyclops and one detail about Circe are confirmed by the rest of the poem.

Story is meant to get something--he wants to get home by convincing them that he's a good guy, on his side, can spread their fame, etc.

He's a performer. He becomes the bard.

Good to be clever and not fully trust memory/what you hear.

---

think of Odyseus not as "good" but as "metis"--cunning intelligence. The intelligence to lead, weave, etc.

## Part 2

The Odyssey is a "merge-matic" text.

Epics tell long story and try to capture everything as they do--like nature, like the world itself.

Survival story, justice & revenge story, homecoming, story of nostalgia.

What does it mean for O to be at home?

noos = consciousness || coming to, so consciousness is like a return.

nostos = returning home.

both come from root "nes" (Nestor = one who brings home)

### It's a family

Story of an absent father (part of why it starts with Telemacus)

Son who doesn't know whether he is a son. Says at one point he's not sure O is his father.

Book 24 brings up O's father. Some thought it wasn't Homeric, thought it ended when they fall into each other's arms.

Aesthetically balances abstract & detail.

### Telemacus

Starts out clueless

First see him through the eyes of Athena.

Part of the Odyssey is immature fantasy that dad will come home and make everything better. (This actually happens)

Mentor = one who reminds.

Menos = strength through (being reminded|memory).

Telemacus on p 13 tells half-truth--already maturing and learning not to tell whole truth to enemies

#### p 61-2

Telemacus recognizes that subsistence economy is good for the soul.

No turn the other cheek--love friends, hurt enemies.

### Odysseus

Becomes human.

First 10 lines sort of justifies O killing the suitors by saying the Sun did it when people ate his cattle.

Book 5 (first with O) alludes to Tithonus, the one who's going to turn into a cicada.

#### p. 89-90

homophrosunae -- like-mindedness

#### p. 201

He's kind of an extortionist--lies very well.

He tries to lie Athena, she catches him.

#### p. 165-

Tells the story of what he's done so far.

Lists 12 women he met in the underworld. Like a chick flick.

Then continues the story with gods and such, and then he stops at the best part until they promise to give him lots of stuff.

---

Doesn't lie to Telemacus.

### Penelope

Holds off the suitors, but it's unclear where her affections lie.

Wears gorgeous clothings, gets the suitors turned on so as to get more stuff from them.

Rumor that Penelope slept with all 108 suitors.

Does she know that it's Odysseus?

Someone claims that she knew it was him even in book 19 before he revealed himself. (She asks him to interperet dream)

---

Book 11 says to die, O must walk so far inland until the people there can't recognize an oar. Then he must plant it and make it a shrine to Posseidon. Then death will come "out of the sea" (either actually from the sea or just far from sea).
