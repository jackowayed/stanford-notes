# Aristotle's Politics

This and *Ethics* were meant to be read together

Defines human community. Natural phenomenon, arises out of biological necessity.

Necessities:

* Reproduction, family (= husband + wife + children + **slaves**)
* Social cooperation

Human community needs to be self-sufficient. Shouldn't depend on another community. Village is too small for that.

Can't grow too large--will lose coherence, stops acting optimally.

Ideal community is the smallest society that can be autonomous, largest community that people know one another.

Humans are political animals

Even with all material goods, prestige, etc in the world, if you live in a community where you can't use your reason with your fellow citizens to determine what is best for you, you aren't as happy as you could be.

By subordinating yourself, you lose your ability to reason about things freely, get highest form of happiness. People can't work for others.

But work needs to be done->natural slaves! People for whom what is best for them *is* taking orders from others.
